<h3><b>First Act</b></h3>


<p><i>The drawingroom in Richard Rowan&rsquo;s house at Merrion, a
suburb of Dublin. On the right, forward, a fireplace, before which
stands a low screen. Over the mantelpiece a giltframed glass. Further
back in the right wall, folding doors leading to the parlour and
kitchen. In the wall at the back to the right a small door leading to a
study. Left of this a sideboard. On the wall above the sideboard a
framed crayon drawing of a young man. More to the left double doors with
glass panels leading out to the garden. In the wall at the left a window
looking out on the road. Forward in the same wall a door leading to the
hall and the upper part of the house. Between the window and door a
lady&rsquo;s davenport stands against the wall. Near it a wicker chair.
In the centre of the room a round table. Chairs, upholstered in faded
green plush, stand round the table. To the right, forward, a smaller
table with a smoking service on it. Near it an easychair and a lounge.
Cocoanut mats lie before the fireplace, beside the lounge and before the
doors. The floor is of stained planking. The double doors at the back
and the folding doors at the right have lace curtains, which are drawn
halfway. The lower sash of the window is lifted and the window is hung
with heavy green plush curtains. The blind is pulled down to the edge of
the lifted lower sash. It is a warm afternoon in June and the room is
filled with soft sunlight which is waning.</i></p>

<p>[<span class="charname">Brigid</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="charname">Beatrice Justice</span> <i>come in by the door on the
left.</i> <span class="charname">Brigid</span> <i>is an elderly woman,
lowsized, with irongrey hair.</i> <span class="charname">Beatrice
Justice</span> <i>is a slender dark young woman of 27 years. She wears a
wellmade navyblue costume and an elegant simply trimmed black straw hat,
and carries a small portfolioshaped handbag.</i>]</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
The mistress and Master Archie is at the bath. They never expected you.
Did you send word you were back, Miss Justice?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
No. I arrived just now.
</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Points to the easychair.</i>] Sit down and I&rsquo;ll tell the
master you are here. Were you long in the train?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Sitting down.</i>] Since morning.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
Master Archie got your postcard with the views of Youghal. You&rsquo;re
tired out, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
O, no. [<i>She coughs rather nervously.</i>] Did he practise the piano
while I was away?</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Laughs heartily.</i>] Practice, how are you! Is it Master Archie? He
is mad after the milkman&rsquo;s horse now. Had you nice weather down
there, Miss Justice?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Rather wet, I think.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Sympathetically.</i>] Look at that now. And there is rain overhead
too. [<i>Moving towards the study.</i>] I&rsquo;ll tell him you are
here.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Is Mr Rowan in?</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Points.</i>] He is in his study. He is wearing himself out about
something he is writing. Up half the night he does be. [<i>Going.</i>]
I&rsquo;ll call him.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Don&rsquo;t disturb him, Brigid. I can wait here till they come back if
they are not long.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
And I saw something in the letterbox when I was letting you in. [<i>She
crosses to the study door, opens it slightly and calls.</i>] Master
Richard, Miss Justice is here for Master Archie&rsquo;s lesson.</p>

<p>[<span class="charname">Richard Rowan</span> <i>comes in from the
study and advances towards</i> <span class="charname">Beatrice</span>,
<i>holding out his hand. He is a tall athletic young man of a rather
lazy carriage. He has light brown hair and a moustache and wears
glasses. He is dressed in loose lightgrey tweed.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Welcome.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Rises and shakes hands, blushing slightly.</i>] Good afternoon, Mr
Rowan. I did not want Brigid to disturb you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Disturb me? My goodness!</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
There is something in the letterbox, sir.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Takes a small bunch of keys from his pocket and hands them to
her.</i>] Here.</p>

<p>[<span class="charname">Brigid</span> <i>goes out by the door at the
left and is heard opening and closing the box. A short pause. She enters
with two newspapers in her hands.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Letters?</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
No, sir. Only them Italian newspapers.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Leave them on my desk, will you?</p>

<p>[<span class="charname">Brigid</span> <i>hands him back the keys,
leaves the newspapers in the study, comes out again and goes out by the
folding doors on the right.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Please, sit down. Bertha will be back in a moment.</p>

<p>[<span class="charname">Beatrice</span> <i>sits down again in the
easychair.</i> <span class="charname">Richard</span> <i>sits beside the
table.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I had begun to think you would never come back. It is twelve days since
you were here.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I thought of that too. But I have come.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Have you thought over what I told you when you were here last?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Very much.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
You must have known it before. Did you? [<i>She does not answer.</i>] Do
you blame me?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
No.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Do you think I have acted towards you&mdash;badly? No? Or towards
anyone?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Looks at him with a sad puzzled expression.</i>] I have asked myself
that question.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
And the answer?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I could not answer it.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
If I were a painter and told you I had a book of sketches of you you
would not think it so strange, would you?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
It is not quite the same case, is it?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Smiles slightly.</i>] Not quite. I told you also that I would not
show you what I had written unless you asked to see it. Well?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I will not ask you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, his hands
joined.</i>] Would you like to see it?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Very much.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Because it is about yourself?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Yes. But not only that.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Because it is written by me? Yes? Even if what you would find there is
sometimes cruel?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Shyly.</i>] That is part of your mind, too.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Then it is my mind that attracts you? Is that it?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Hesitating, glances at him for an instant.</i>] Why do you think I
come here?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Why? Many reasons. To give Archie lessons. We have known one another so
many years, from childhood, Robert, you and I&mdash;haven&rsquo;t we?
You have always been interested in me, before I went away and while I
was away. Then our letters to each other about my book. Now it is
published. I am here again. Perhaps you feel that some new thing is
gathering in my brain; perhaps you feel that you
should know it. Is that the reason?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
No.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Why, then?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Otherwise I could not see you.</p>

<p>[<i>She looks at him for a moment and then turns aside
quickly.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>After a pause repeats uncertainly.</i>] Otherwise you could not see
me?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Suddenly confused.</i>] I had better go. They are not coming back.
[<i>Rising.</i>] Mr Rowan, I must go.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Extending his arms.</i>] But you are running away. Remain. Tell me
what your words mean. Are you afraid of me?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Sinks back again.</i>] Afraid? No.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Have you confidence in me? Do you feel that you know me?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Again shyly.</i>] It is hard to know anyone but oneself.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Hard to know me? I sent you from Rome the chapters of my book as I wrote
them; and letters for nine long years. Well, eight years.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Yes, it was nearly a year before your first letter came.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
It was answered at once by you. And from that on you have watched me in
my struggle. [<i>Joins his hands earnestly.</i>] Tell me, Miss Justice,
did you feel that what you read was written for your eyes? Or that you
inspired me?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Shakes her head.</i>] I need not answer that question.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
What then?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Is silent for a moment.</i>] I cannot say it. You yourself must ask
me, Mr Rowan.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>With some vehemence.</i>] Then that I expressed in those chapters
and letters, and in my character and life as well, something in your
soul which you could not&mdash;pride or scorn?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Could not?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Leans towards her.</i>] Could not because you dared not. Is that
why?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Bends her head.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
On account of others or for want of courage&mdash;which?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Softly.</i>] Courage.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Slowly.</i>] And so you have followed me with pride and scorn also
in your heart?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
And loneliness.</p>

<p>[<i>She leans her head on her hand, averting her face.
<span class="charname">Richard</span> rises and walks slowly to the
window on the left. He looks out for some moments and then returns
towards her, crosses to the lounge and sits down near her.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Do you love him still?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I do not even know.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
It was that that made me so reserved with you&mdash;then&mdash;even
though I felt your interest in me, even though I felt that I too was
something in your life.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
You were.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yet that separated me from you. I was a third person, I felt. Your names
were always spoken together, Robert and Beatrice, as long as I can
remember. It seemed to me, to everyone...</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
We are first cousins. It is not strange that we were often together.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
He told me of your secret engagement with him. He had no secrets from
me; I suppose you know that.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Uneasily.</i>] What happened&mdash;between us&mdash;is so long ago.
I was a child.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Smiles maliciously.</i>] A child? Are you sure? It was in the garden
of his mother&rsquo;s house. No? [<i>He points towards the garden.</i>]
Over there. You plighted your troth, as they say, with a kiss. And you
gave him your garter. Is it allowed to mention that?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>With some reserve.</i>] If you think it worthy of mention.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I think you have not forgotten it. [<i>Clasping his hands quietly.</i>]
I do not understand it. I thought, too, that after I had gone... Did my
going make you suffer?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I always knew you would go some day. I did not suffer; only I was
changed.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Towards him?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Everything was changed. His life, his mind, even, seemed to change after
that.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Musing.</i>] Yes. I saw that you had changed when I received your
first letter after a year; after your illness, too. You even said so in
your letter.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
It brought me near to death. It made me see things differently.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
And so a coldness began between you, little by little. Is that it?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Half closing her eyes.</i>] No. Not at once. I saw in him a pale
reflection of you: then that too faded. Of what good is it to talk
now?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>With a repressed energy.</i>] But what is this that seems to hang
over you? It cannot be so tragic.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Calmly.</i>] O, not in the least tragic. I shall become gradually
better, they tell me, as I grow older. As I did not die then they tell
me I shall probably live. I am given life and health again&mdash;when I
cannot use them. [<i>Calmly and bitterly.</i>] I am convalescent.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Gently.</i>] Does nothing then in life give you peace? Surely it
exists for you somewhere.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
If there were convents in our religion perhaps there. At least, I think
so at times.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Shakes his head.</i>] No, Miss Justice, not even there. You could
not give yourself freely and wholly.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Looking at him.</i>] I would try.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
You would try, yes. You were drawn to him as your mind was drawn towards
mine. You held back from him. From me, too, in a different way. You
cannot give yourself freely and wholly.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Joins her hands softly.</i>] It is a terribly hard thing to do, Mr
Rowan&mdash;to give oneself freely and wholly&mdash;and be happy.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
But do you feel that happiness is the best, the highest that we can
know?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>With fervour.</i>] I wish I could feel it.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Leans back, his hands locked together behind his head.</i>] O, if
you knew how I am suffering at this moment! For your case, too. But
suffering most of all for my own. [<i>With bitter force.</i>] And how I
pray that I may be granted again my dead mother&rsquo;s hardness of
heart! For some help, within me or without, I must find. And find it I
will.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Beatrice</span> rises, looks at him
intently, and walks away toward the garden door. She turns with
indecision, looks again at him and, coming back, leans over the
easychair.</i>]</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Quietly.</i>] Did she send for you before she died, Mr Rowan?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Lost in thought.</i>] Who?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Your mother.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Recovering himself, looks keenly at her for a moment.</i>] So that,
too, was said of me here by my friends&mdash;that she sent for me before
she died and that I did not go?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Coldly.</i>] She did not. She died alone, not having forgiven me,
and fortified by the rites of holy church.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Mr Rowan, why did you speak to me in such a way?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Rises and walks nervously to and fro.</i>] And what I suffer at this
moment you will say is my punishment.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Did she write to you? I mean before...</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Halting.</i>] Yes. A letter of warning, bidding me break with the
past, and remember her last words to me.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Softly.</i>] And does death not move you, Mr Rowan? It is an end.
Everything else is so uncertain.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
While she lived she turned aside from me and from mine. That is
certain.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
From you and from...?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
From Bertha and from me and from our child. And so I waited for the end
as you say; and it came.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Covers her face with her hands.</i>] O, no. Surely no.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Fiercely.</i>] How can my words hurt her poor body that rots in the
grave? Do you think I do not pity her cold blighted love for me? I
fought against her spirit while she lived to the bitter end. [<i>He
presses his hand to his forehead.</i>] It fights against me
still&mdash;in here.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>As before.</i>] O, do not speak like that.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
She drove me away. On account of her I lived years in exile and poverty
too, or near it. I never accepted the doles she sent me through the
bank. I waited, too, not for her death but for some understanding of me,
her own son, her own flesh and blood; that never came.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Not even after Archie...?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Rudely.</i>] My son, you think? A child of sin and shame! Are you
serious? [<i>She raises her face and looks at him.</i>] There were
tongues here ready to tell her all, to embitter her withering mind still
more against me and Bertha and our godless nameless child. [<i>Holding
out his hands to her.</i>] Can you not hear her mocking me while I
speak? You must know the voice, surely, the voice that called you <i>the
black protestant</i>, the pervert&rsquo;s daughter. [<i>With sudden
selfcontrol.</i>] In any case a remarkable woman.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Weakly.</i>] At least you are free now.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Nods.</i>] Yes, she could not alter the terms of my father&rsquo;s
will nor live for ever.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>With joined hands.</i>] They are both gone now, Mr Rowan. They both
loved you, believe me. Their last thoughts were of you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Approaching, touches her lightly on the shoulder, and points to the
crayon drawing on the wall.</i>] Do you see him there, smiling and
handsome? His last thoughts! I remember the night he died. [<i>He pauses
for an instant and then goes on calmly.</i>] I was a boy of fourteen. He
called me to his bedside. He knew I wanted to go to the theatre to hear
<i>Carmen</i>. He told my mother to give me a shilling. I kissed him and
went. When I came home he was dead. Those were his last thoughts as far
as I know.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
The hardness of heart you prayed for... [<i>She breaks off.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Unheeding.</i>] That is my last memory of him. Is there not
something sweet and noble in it?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Mr Rowan, something is on your mind to make you speak like this.
Something has changed you since you came back three months ago.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Gazing again at the drawing, calmly, almost gaily.</i>] He will help
me, perhaps, my smiling handsome father.</p>

<p>[<i>A knock is heard at the hall door on the left.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Suddenly.</i>] No, no. Not the smiler, Miss Justice. The old mother.
It is her spirit I need. I am going.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Someone knocked. They have come back.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
No, Bertha has a key. It is he. At least, I am going, whoever it is.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out quickly on the left and comes back at once with his
straw hat in his hand.</i>]</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
He? Who?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
O, probably Robert. I am going out through the garden. I cannot see him
now. Say I have gone to the post. Goodbye.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>With growing alarm.</i>] It is Robert you do not wish to see?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Quietly.</i>] For the moment, yes. This talk has upset me. Ask him
to wait.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
You will come back?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Please God.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out quickly through the garden. <span

stops after a few paces. <span class="charname">Brigid</span> enters by

bunch of red roses wrapped in tissue paper.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Coming towards her with outstretched hand which she takes.</i>] My
dearest coz! Brigid told me you were here. I had no notion. Did you send
mother a telegram?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Gazing at the roses.</i>] No.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Following her gaze.</i>] You are admiring my roses. I brought them
to the mistress of the house. [<i>Critically.</i>] I am afraid they are
not nice.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
O, they are lovely, sir. The mistress will be delighted with them.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Lays the roses carelessly on a chair out of sight.</i>] Is nobody
in?</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
Yes, sir. Sit down, sir. They&rsquo;ll be here now any moment. The
master was here.</p>

<p>[<i>She looks about her and with a half curtsey goes out on the
right.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>After a short silence.</i>] How are you, Beatty? And how are all
down in Youghal? As dull as ever?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
They were well when I left.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Politely.</i>] O, but I&rsquo;m sorry I did not know you were
coming. I would have met you at the train. Why did you do it? You have
some queer ways about you, Beatty, haven&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>In the same tone.</i>] Thank you, Robert. I am quite used to getting
about alone.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes, but I mean to say... O, well, you have arrived in your own
characteristic way.</p>

<p>[<i>A noise is heard at the window and a boy&rsquo;s voice is heard
calling, &lsquo;Mr Hand!&rsquo; <span class="charname">Robert</span>
turns.</i>]</p>

<p>By Jove, Archie, too, is arriving in a characteristic way!</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Archie</span> scrambles into the room
through the open window on the left and then rises to his feet, flushed
and panting. <span class="charname">Archie</span> is a boy of eight
years, dressed in white breeches, jersey and cap. He wears spectacles,
has a lively manner and speaks with the slight trace of a foreign
accent.</i>]</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Going towards him.</i>] Goodness gracious, Archie! What is the
matter?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Rising, out of breath.</i>] Eh! I ran all the avenue.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Smiles and holds out his hand.</i>] Good evening, Archie. Why did
you run?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Shakes hands.</i>] Good evening. We saw you on the top of the tram,
and I shouted <i>Mr Hand!</i> But you did not see me. But we saw you,
mamma and I. She will be here in a minute. I ran.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Holding out her hand.</i>] And poor me!</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Shakes hands somewhat shyly.</i>] Good evening, Miss Justice.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Were you disappointed that I did not come last Friday for the
lesson?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Glancing at her, smiles.</i>] No.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Glad?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Suddenly.</i>] But today it is too late.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
A very short lesson?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Pleased.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
But now you must study, Archie.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Were you at the bath?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Are you a good swimmer now?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Leans against the davenport.</i>] No. Mamma won&rsquo;t let me into
the deep place. Can you swim well, Mr Hand?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Splendidly. Like a stone.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Laughs.</i>] Like a stone! [<i>Pointing down.</i>] Down that
way?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Pointing.</i>] Yes, down; straight down. How do you say that over in
Italy?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
That? <i>Giù.</i> [<i>Pointing down and up.</i>] That is <i>giù</i>
and this is <i>sù</i>. Do you want to speak to my pappie?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes. I came to see him.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Going towards the study.</i>] I will tell him. He is in there,
writing.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Calmly, looking at <span class="charname">Robert</span>.</i>] No; he
is out. He is gone to the post with some letters.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Lightly.</i>] O, never mind. I will wait if he is only gone to the
post.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
But mamma is coming. [<i>He glances towards the window.</i>] Here she
is!</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Archie</span> runs out by the door on the
left. <span class="charname">Beatrice</span> walks slowly towards the
davenport. <span class="charname">Robert</span> remains standing. A

<span class="charname">Bertha</span> is a young woman of graceful build.

manner is cordial and selfpossessed. She wears a lavender dress and

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Shaking hands.</i>] Good evening, Miss Justice. We thought you were
still down in Youghal.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Shaking hands.</i>] Good evening, Mrs Rowan.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Bows.</i>] Good evening, Mr Hand.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Bowing.</i>] Good evening, <i>signora!</i> Just imagine, I
didn&rsquo;t know either she was back till I found her here.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>To both.</i>] Did you not come together?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
No. I came first. Mr Rowan was going out. He said you would be back any
moment.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I&rsquo;m sorry. If you had written or sent over word by the girl this
morning...</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Laughs nervously.</i>] I arrived only an hour and a half ago. I
thought of sending a telegram but it seemed too tragic.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Ah? Only now you arrived?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Extending his arms, blandly.</i>] I retire from public and private
life. Her first cousin and a journalist, I know nothing of her
movements.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Not directly to him.</i>] My movements are not very interesting.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>In the same tone.</i>] A lady&rsquo;s movements are always
interesting.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
But sit down, won&rsquo;t you? You must be very tired.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Quickly.</i>] No, not at all. I just came for Archie&rsquo;s
lesson.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I wouldn&rsquo;t hear of such a thing, Miss Justice, after your long
journey.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Suddenly to <span class="charname">Beatrice</span>.</i>] And,
besides, you didn&rsquo;t bring the music.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>A little confused.</i>] That I forgot. But we have the old
piece.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Pinching <span class="charname">Archie&rsquo;s</span> ear.</i>] You
little scamp. You want to get off the lesson.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
O, never mind the lesson. You must sit down and have a cup of tea now.
[<i>Going towards the door on the right.</i>] I&rsquo;ll tell
Brigid.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
I will, mamma. [<i>He makes a movement to go.</i>]</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
No, please Mrs Rowan. Archie! I would really prefer...</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Quietly.</i>] I suggest a compromise. Let it be a half-lesson.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
But she must be exhausted.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Quickly.</i>] Not in the least. I was thinking of the lesson in the
train.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>To <span class="charname">Bertha</span>.</i>] You see what it is to
have a conscience, Mrs Rowan.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Of my lesson, Miss Justice?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Simply.</i>] It is ten days since I heard the sound of a piano.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
O, very well. If that is it...</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Nervously, gaily.</i>] Let us have the piano by all means. I know
what is in Beatty&rsquo;s ears at this moment. [<i>To <span
class="charname">Beatrice</span>.</i>] Shall I tell?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
If you know.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
The buzz of the harmonium in her father&rsquo;s parlour. [<i>To
<span class="charname">Beatrice</span>.</i>] Confess.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Smiling.</i>] Yes. I can hear it.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Grimly.</i>] So can I. The asthmatic voice of protestantism.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Did you not enjoy yourself down there, Miss Justice?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Intervenes.</i>] She did not, Mrs Rowan. She goes there on retreat,
when the protestant strain in her prevails&mdash;gloom, seriousness,
righteousness.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I go to see my father.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Continuing.</i>] But she comes back here to my mother, you see. The
piano influence is from our side of the house.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Hesitating.</i>] Well, Miss Justice, if you would like to play
something... But please don&rsquo;t fatigue yourself with Archie.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Suavely.</i>] Do, Beatty. That is what you want.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
If Archie will come?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>With a shrug.</i>] To listen.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Takes his hand.</i>] And a little lesson, too. Very short.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Well, afterwards you must stay to tea.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>To <span class="charname">Archie</span>.</i>] Come.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Beatrice</span> and <span
class="charname">Archie</span> go out together by the door on the left.
<span class="charname">Bertha</span> goes towards the davenport, takes
off her hat and lays it with her sunshade on the desk. Then taking a key
from a little flowervase, she opens a drawer of the davenport, takes out
a slip of paper and closes the drawer again. <span
class="charname">Robert</span> stands watching her.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Coming towards him with the paper in her hand.</i>] You put this
into my hand last night. What does it mean?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Do you not know?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Reads.</i>] <i>There is one word which I have never dared to say to
you.</i> What is the word?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
That I have a deep liking for you.</p>

<p>[<i>A short pause. The piano is heard faintly from the upper
room.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Takes the bunch of roses from the chair.</i>] I brought these for
you. Will you take them from me?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Taking them.</i>] Thank you. [<i>She lays them on the table and
unfolds the paper again.</i>] Why did you not dare to say it last
night?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I could not speak to you or follow you. There were too many people on
the lawn. I wanted you to think over it and so I put it into your hand
when you were going away.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Now you have dared to say it.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Moves his hand slowly past his eyes.</i>] You passed. The avenue was
dim with dusky light. I could see the dark green masses of the trees.
And you passed beyond them. You were like the moon.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Laughs.</i>] Why like the moon?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
In that dress, with your slim body, walking with little even steps. I
saw the moon passing in the dusk till you passed and left my sight.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Did you think of me last night?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Comes nearer.</i>] I think of you always&mdash;as something
beautiful and distant&mdash;the moon or some deep music.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Smiling.</i>] And last night which was I?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I was awake half the night. I could hear your voice. I could see your
face in the dark. Your eyes... I want to speak to you. Will you listen
to me? May I speak?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Sitting down.</i>] You may.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Sitting beside her.</i>] Are you annoyed with me?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I thought you were. You put away my poor flowers so quickly.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Takes them from the table and holds them close to her face.</i>] Is
this what you wish me to do with them?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Watching her.</i>] Your face is a flower too&mdash;but more
beautiful. A wild flower blowing in a hedge. [<i>Moving his chair closer
to her.</i>] Why are you smiling? At my words?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Laying the flowers in her lap.</i>] I am wondering if that is what
you say&mdash;to the others.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Surprised.</i>] What others?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
The other women. I hear you have so many admirers.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Involuntarily.</i>] And that is why you too...?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
But you have, haven&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Friends, yes.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Do you speak to them in the same way?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>In an offended tone.</i>] How can you ask me such a question? What
kind of person do you think I am? Or why do you listen to me? Did you
not like me to speak to you in that way?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
What you said was very kind. [<i>She looks at him for a moment.</i>]
Thank you for saying it&mdash;and thinking it.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Leaning forward.</i>] Bertha!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I have the right to call you by your name. From old times&mdash;nine
years ago. We were Bertha&mdash;and Robert&mdash;then. Can we not be so
now, too?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Readily.</i>] O yes. Why should we not?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Bertha, you knew. From the very night you landed on Kingstown pier. It
all came back to me then. And you knew it. You saw it.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No. Not that night.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
When?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
The night we landed I felt very tired and dirty. [<i>Shaking her
head.</i>] I did not see it in you that night.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Smiling.</i>] Tell me what did you see that night&mdash;your very
first impression.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Knitting her brows.</i>] You were standing with your back to the
gangway, talking to two ladies.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
To two plain middleaged ladies, yes.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I recognized you at once. And I saw that you had got fat.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Takes her hand.</i>] And this poor fat Robert&mdash;do you dislike
him then so much? Do you disbelieve all he says?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I think men speak like that to all women whom they like or admire. What
do you want me to believe?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
All men, Bertha?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>With sudden sadness.</i>] I think so.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I too?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes, Robert. I think you too.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
All then&mdash;without exception? Or with one exception? [<i>In a lower
tone.</i>] Or is he too&mdash;Richard too&mdash;like us all&mdash;in
that at least? Or different?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looks into his eyes.</i>] Different.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Are you quite sure, Bertha?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>A little confused, tries to withdraw her hand.</i>] I have answered
you.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Suddenly.</i>] Bertha, may I kiss your hand? Let me. May I?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
If you wish.</p>

<p>[<i>He lifts her hand to his lips slowly. She rises suddenly and
listens.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Did you hear the garden gate?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Rising also.</i>] No.</p>

<p>[<i>A short pause. The piano can be heard faintly from the upper
room.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Pleading.</i>] Do not go away. You must never go away now. Your life
is here. I came for that too today&mdash;to speak to him&mdash;to urge
him to accept this position. He must. And you must persuade him to. You
have a great influence over him.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
You want him to remain here.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Why?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
For your sake because you are unhappy so far away. For his sake too
because he should think of his future.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Laughing.</i>] Do you remember what he said when you spoke to him
last night?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
About...? [<i>Reflecting.</i>] Yes. He quoted the <i>Our Father</i>
about our daily bread. He said that to take care for the future is to
destroy hope and love in the world.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Do you not think he is strange?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
In that, yes.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
A little&mdash;mad?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Comes closer.</i>] No. He is not. Perhaps we are. Why, do
you...?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Laughs.</i>] I ask you because you are intelligent.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
You must not go away. I will not let you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looks full at him.</i>] You?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Those eyes must not go away. [<i>He takes her hands.</i>] May I kiss
your eyes?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Do so.</p>

<p>[<i>He kisses her eyes and then passes his hand over her
hair.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Little Bertha!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Smiling.</i>] But I am not so little. Why do you call me little?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Little Bertha! One embrace? [<i>He puts his arm around her.</i>] Look
into my eyes again.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looks.</i>] I can see the little gold spots. So many you have.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Delighted.</i>] Your voice! Give me a kiss, a kiss with your
mouth.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Take it.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I am afraid. [<i>He kisses her mouth and passes his hand many times over
her hair.</i>] At last I hold you in my arms!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
And are you satisfied?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Let me feel your lips touch mine.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
And then you will be satisfied?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Murmurs.</i>] Your lips, Bertha!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Closes her eyes and kisses him quickly.</i>] There. [<i>Puts her
hands on his shoulders.</i>] Why don&rsquo;t you say: thanks?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Sighs.</i>] My life is finished&mdash;over.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
O, don&rsquo;t speak like that now, Robert.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Over, over. I want to end it and have done with it.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Concerned but lightly.</i>] You silly fellow!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Presses her to him.</i>] To end it all&mdash;death. To fall from a
great high cliff, down, right down into the sea.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Please, Robert...</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Listening to music and in the arms of the woman I love&mdash;the sea,
music and death.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looks at him for a moment.</i>] The woman you love?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Hurriedly.</i>] I want to speak to you, Bertha&mdash;alone&mdash;not
here. Will you come?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>With downcast eyes.</i>] I too want to speak to you.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Tenderly.</i>] Yes, dear, I know. [<i>He kisses her again.</i>] I
will speak to you; tell you all; then. I will kiss you, then, long long
kisses&mdash;when you come to me&mdash;long long sweet kisses.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Where?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>In the tone of passion.</i>] Your eyes. Your lips. All your divine
body.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Repelling his embrace, confused.</i>] I meant where do you wish me
to come.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
To my house. Not my mother&rsquo;s over there. I will write the address
for you. Will you come?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
When?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Tonight. Between eight and nine. Come. I will wait for you tonight. And
every night. You will?</p>

<p>[<i>He kisses her with passion, holding her head between his hands.
After a few instants she breaks from him. He sits down.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Listening.</i>] The gate opened.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Intensely.</i>] I will wait for you.</p>

<p>[<i>He takes the slip from the table. <span
class="charname">Bertha</span> moves away from him slowly. <span
class="charname">Richard</span> comes in from the garden.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Advancing, takes off his hat.</i>] Good afternoon.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Rises, with nervous friendliness.</i>] Good afternoon, Richard.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>At the table, taking the roses.</i>] Look what lovely roses Mr Hand
brought me.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I am afraid they are overblown.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Suddenly.</i>] Excuse me for a moment, will you?</p>

<p>[<i>He turns and goes into his study quickly. <span
class="charname">Robert</span> takes a pencil from his pocket and writes
a few words on the slip; then hands it quickly to <span
class="charname">Bertha</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Rapidly.</i>] The address. Take the tram at Lansdowne Road and ask
to be let down near there.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Takes it.</i>] I promise nothing.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I will wait.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Richard</span> comes back from the
study.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Going.</i>] I must put these roses in water.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Handing her his hat.</i>] Yes, do. And please put my hat on the
rack.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Takes it.</i>] So I will leave you to yourselves for your talk.
[<i>Looking round.</i>] Do you want anything? Cigarettes?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Thanks. We have them here.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Then I can go?</p>

<p>[<i>She goes out on the left with <span
class="charname">Richard&rsquo;s</span> hat, which she leaves in the
hall, and returns at once; she stops for a moment at the davenport,
replaces the slip in the drawer, locks it, and replaces the key, and,
taking the roses, goes towards the right. <span
class="charname">Robert</span> precedes her to open the door for her.
She bows and goes out.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Points to the chair near the little table on the right.</i>] Your
place of honour.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Sits down.</i>] Thanks. [<i>Passing his hand over his brow.</i>]
Good Lord, how warm it is today! The heat pains me here in the eye. The
glare.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
The room is rather dark, I think, with the blind down but if you
wish...</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Quickly.</i>] Not at all. I know what it is&mdash;the result of
night work.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Sits on the lounge.</i>] Must you?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Sighs.</i>] Eh, yes. I must see part of the paper through every
night. And then my leading articles. We are approaching a difficult
moment. And not only here.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>After a slight pause.</i>] Have you any news?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>In a different voice.</i>] Yes. I want to speak to you seriously.
Today may be an important day for you&mdash;or rather, tonight. I saw
the vicechancellor this morning. He has the highest opinion of you,
Richard. He has read your book, he said.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Did he buy it or borrow it?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Bought it, I hope.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I shall smoke a cigarette. Thirtyseven copies have now been sold in
Dublin.</p>

<p>[<i>He takes a cigarette from the box on the table, and lights
it.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Suavely, hopelessly.</i>] Well, the matter is closed for the
present. You have your iron mask on today.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Smoking.</i>] Let me hear the rest.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Again seriously.</i>] Richard, you are too suspicious. It is a
defect in you. He assured me he has the highest possible opinion of you,
as everyone has. You are the man for the post, he says. In fact, he told
me that, if your name goes forward, he will work might and main for you
with the senate and I... will do my part, of course, in the press and
privately. I regard it as a public duty. The chair of romance literature
is yours by right, as a scholar, as a literary personality.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
The conditions?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Conditions? You mean about the future?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I mean about the past.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Easily.</i>] That episode in your past is forgotten. An act of
impulse. We are all impulsive.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Looks fixedly at him.</i>] You called it an act of folly,
then&mdash;nine years ago. You told me I was hanging a weight about my
neck.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I was wrong. [<i>Suavely.</i>] Here is how the matter stands, Richard.
Everyone knows that you ran away years ago with a young girl... How
shall I put it?... with a young girl not exactly your equal.
[<i>Kindly.</i>] Excuse me, Richard, that is not my opinion nor my
language. I am simply using the language of people whose opinions I
don&rsquo;t share.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Writing one of your leading articles, in fact.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Put it so. Well, it made a great sensation at the time. A mysterious
disappearance. My name was involved too, as best man, let us say, on
that famous occasion. Of course, they think I acted from a mistaken
sense of friendship. Well, all that is known. [<i>With some
hesitation.</i>] But what happened afterwards is not known.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
No?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Of course, it is your affair, Richard. However, you are not so young now
as you were then. The expression is quite in the style of my leading
articles, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Do you, or do you not, want me to give the lie to my past life?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I am thinking of your future life&mdash;here. I understand your pride
and your sense of liberty. I understand their point of view also.
However, there is a way out; it is simply this. Refrain from
contradicting any rumours you may hear concerning what happened... or
did not happen after you went away. Leave the rest to me.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
You will set these rumours afloat?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I will. God help me.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Observing him.</i>] For the sake of social conventions?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
For the sake of something else too&mdash;our friendship, our lifelong
friendship.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Thanks.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Slightly wounded.</i>] And I will tell you the whole truth.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Smiles and bows.</i>] Yes. Do, please.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Not only for your sake. Also for the sake of&mdash;your present partner
in life.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I see.</p>

<p>[<i>He crushes his cigarette softly on the ashtray and then leans
forward, rubbing his hands slowly.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Why for her sake?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Also leans forward, quietly.</i>] Richard, have you been quite fair
to her? It was her own free choice, you will say. But was she really
free to choose? She was a mere girl. She accepted all that you
proposed.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Smiles.</i>] That is your way of saying that she proposed what I
would not accept.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Nods.</i>] I remember. And she went away with you. But was it of her
own free choice? Answer me frankly.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Turns to him, calmly.</i>] I played for her against all that you say
or can say; and I won.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Nodding again.</i>] Yes, you won.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Rises.</i>] Excuse me for forgetting. Will you have some whisky?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
All things come to those who wait.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Richard</span> goes to the sideboard and
brings a small tray with the decanter and glasses to the table where he
sets it down.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Sits down again, leaning back on the lounge.</i>] Will you please
help yourself?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Does so.</i>] And you? Steadfast? [<i><span
class="charname">Richard</span> shakes his head.</i>] Lord, when I think
of our wild nights long ago&mdash;talks by the hour, plans, carouses,
revelry...</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
In our house.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
It is mine now. I have kept it ever since though I don&rsquo;t go there
often. Whenever you like to come let me know. You must come some night.
It will be old times again. [<i>He lifts his glass and drinks.</i>]
<i>Prosit!</i></p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
It was not only a house of revelry; it was to be the hearth of a new
life. [<i>Musing.</i>] And in that name all our sins were committed.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Sins! Drinking and blasphemy [<i>he points</i>] by me. And drinking and
heresy, much worse [<i>he points again</i>] by you&mdash;are those the
sins you mean?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
And some others.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Lightly, uneasily.</i>] You mean the women. I have no remorse of
conscience. Maybe you have. We had two keys on those occasions.
[<i>Maliciously.</i>] Have you?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Irritated.</i>] For you it was all quite natural?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
For me it is quite natural to kiss a woman whom I like. Why not? She is
beautiful for me.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Toying with the lounge cushion.</i>] Do you kiss everything that is
beautiful for you?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Everything&mdash;if it can be kissed. [<i>He takes up a flat stone which
lies on the table.</i>] This stone, for instance. It is so cool, so
polished, so delicate, like a woman&rsquo;s temple. It is silent, it
suffers our passion; and it is beautiful. [<i>He places it against his
lips.</i>] And so I kiss it because it is beautiful. And what is a
woman? A work of nature, too, like a stone or a flower or a bird. A kiss
is an act of homage.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
It is an act of union between man and woman. Even if we are often led to
desire through the sense of beauty can you say that the beautiful is
what we desire?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Pressing the stone to his forehead.</i>] You will give me a headache
if you make me think today. I cannot think today. I feel too natural,
too common. After all, what is most attractive in even the most
beautiful woman?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
What?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Not those qualities which she has and other women have not but the
qualities which she has in common with them. I mean... the commonest.
[<i>Turning over the stone, he presses the other side to his
forehead.</i>] I mean how her body develops heat when it is pressed, the
movement of her blood, how quickly she changes by digestion what she
eats into&mdash;what shall be nameless. [<i>Laughing.</i>] I am very
common today. Perhaps that idea never struck you?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Drily.</i>] Many ideas strike a man who has lived nine years with a
woman.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes. I suppose they do.... This beautiful cool stone does me good. Is it
a paperweight or a cure for headache?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Bertha brought it home one day from the strand. She, too, says that it
is beautiful.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Lays down the stone quietly.</i>] She is right.</p>

<p>[<i>He raises his glass and drinks. A pause.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Is that all you wanted to say to me?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Quickly.</i>] There is something else. The vicechancellor sends you,
through me, an invitation for tonight&mdash;to dinner at his house. You
know where he lives? [<i><span class="charname">Richard</span>
nods.</i>] I thought you might have forgotten. Strictly private, of
course. He wants to meet you again and sends you a very warm
invitation.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
For what hour?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Eight. But, like yourself, he is free and easy about time. Now, Richard,
you must go there. That is all. I feel tonight will be the turningpoint
in your life. You will live here and work here and think here and be
honoured here&mdash;among our people.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Smiling.</i>] I can almost see two envoys starting for the United
States to collect funds for my statue a hundred years hence.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Agreeably.</i>] Once I made a little epigram about statues. All
statues are of two kinds. [<i>He folds his arms across his chest.</i>]
The statue which says: <i>How shall I get down?</i> and the other kind
[<i>he unfolds his arms and extends his right arm, averting his
head</i>] the statue which says: <i>In my time the dunghill was so
high.</i></p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
The second one for me, please.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Lazily.</i>] Will you give me one of those long cigars of yours?</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Richard</span> selects a Virginia cigar
from the box on the table and hands it to him with the straw drawn
out.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Lighting it.</i>] These cigars Europeanize me. If Ireland is to
become a new Ireland she must first become European. And that is what
you are here for, Richard. Some day we shall have to choose between
England and Europe. I am a descendant of the dark foreigners: that is
why I like to be here. I may be childish. But where else in Dublin can I
get a bandit cigar like this or a cup of black coffee? The man who
drinks black coffee is going to conquer Ireland. And now I will take
just a half measure of that whisky, Richard, to show you there is no ill
feeling.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Points.</i>] Help yourself.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Does so.</i>] Thanks. [<i>He drinks and goes on as before.</i>] Then
you yourself, the way you loll on that lounge: then your boy&rsquo;s
voice and also&mdash;Bertha herself. Do you allow me to call her that,
Richard? I mean as an old friend of both of you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
O why not?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>With animation.</i>] You have that fierce indignation which
lacerated the heart of Swift. You have fallen from a higher world,
Richard, and you are filled with fierce indignation, when you find that
life is cowardly and ignoble. While I... shall I tell you?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
By all means.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Archly.</i>] I have come up from a lower world and I am filled with
astonishment when I find that people have any redeeming virtue at
all.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Sits up suddenly and leans his elbows on the table.</i>] You are my
friend, then?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Gravely.</i>] I fought for you all the time you were away. I fought
to bring you back. I fought to keep your place for you here. I will
fight for you still because I have faith in you, the faith of a disciple
in his master. I cannot say more than that. It may seem strange to
you... Give me a match.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Lights and offers him a match.</i>] There is a faith still stranger
than the faith of the disciple in his master.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
And that is?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
The faith of a master in the disciple who will betray him.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
The church lost a theologian in you, Richard. But I think you look too
deeply into life. [<i>He rises, pressing <span
class="charname">Richard&rsquo;s</span> arm slightly.</i>] Be gay. Life
is not worth it.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Without rising.</i>] Are you going?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Must. [<i>He turns and says in a friendly tone.</i>] Then it is all
arranged. We meet tonight at the vicechancellor&rsquo;s. I shall look in
at about ten. So you can have an hour or so to yourselves first. You
will wait till I come?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Good.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
One more match and I am happy.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Richard</span> strikes another match,
hands it to him and rises also. <span class="charname">Archie</span>
comes in by the door on the left, followed by <span
class="charname">Beatrice</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Congratulate me, Beatty. I have won over Richard.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Crossing to the door on the right, calls.</i>] Mamma, Miss Justice
is going.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
On what are you to be congratulated?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
On a victory, of course. [<i>Laying his hand lightly on
<span class="charname">Richard&rsquo;s</span> shoulder.</i>] The
descendant of Archibald Hamilton Rowan has come home.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I am not a descendant of Hamilton Rowan.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
What matter?</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Bertha</span> comes in from the right with
a bowl of roses.</i>]</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Has Mr Rowan...?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Turning towards <span class="charname">Bertha</span>.</i>] Richard
is coming tonight to the vicechancellor&rsquo;s dinner. The fatted calf
will be eaten: roast, I hope. And next session will see the descendant
of a namesake of etcetera, etcetera in a chair of the university. [<i>He
offers his hand.</i>] Good afternoon, Richard. We shall meet
tonight.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Touches his hand.</i>] At Philippi.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Shakes hands also.</i>] Accept my best wishes, Mr Rowan.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Thanks. But do not believe him.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Vivaciously.</i>] Believe me, believe me.
[<i>To <span class="charname">Bertha</span>.</i>] Good afternoon, Mrs
Rowan.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Shaking hands, candidly.</i>] I thank you, too. [<i>To
<span class="charname">Beatrice</span>.</i>] You won&rsquo;t stay to
tea, Miss Justice?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
No, thank you. [<i>Takes leave of her.</i>] I must go. Good afternoon.
Goodbye, Archie [<i>going</i>].</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
<i>Addio</i>, Archibald.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
<i>Addio</i>.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Wait, Beatty. I shall accompany you.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Going out on the right with <span
class="charname">Bertha</span>.</i>] O, don&rsquo;t trouble.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Following her.</i>] But I insist&mdash;as a cousin.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
I say, pappie!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Absently.</i>] What is it?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
I want to ask you a thing.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Sitting on the end of the lounge, stares in front of him.</i>] What
is it?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Will you ask mamma to let me go out in the morning with the milkman?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
With the milkman?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Yes. In the milkcar. He says he will let me drive when we get on to the
roads where there are no people. The horse is a very good beast. Can I
go?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Ask mamma now can I go. Will you?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Glances towards the door.</i>] I will.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
He said he will show me the cows he has in the field. Do you know how
many cows he has?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
How many?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Eleven. Eight red and three white. But one is sick now. No, not sick.
But it fell.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Cows?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>With a gesture.</i>] Eh! Not bulls. Because bulls give no milk.
Eleven cows. They must give a lot of milk. What makes a cow give
milk?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Takes his hand.</i>] Who knows? Do you understand what it is to give
a thing?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
To give? Yes.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
While you have a thing it can be taken from you.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
By robbers? No?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
But when you give it, you have given it. No robber can take it from you.
[<i>He bends his head and presses his son&rsquo;s hand against his
cheek.</i>] It is yours then for ever when you have given it. It will be
yours always. That is to give.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
But, pappie?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
How could a robber rob a cow? Everyone would see him. In the night,
perhaps.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
In the night, yes.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Are there robbers here like in Rome?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
There are poor people everywhere.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Have they revolvers?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
No.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Knives? Have they knives?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Sternly.</i>] Yes, yes. Knives and revolvers.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Disengages himself.</i>] Ask mamma now. She is coming.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Makes a movement to rise.</i>] I will.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
No, sit there, pappie. You wait and ask her when she comes back. I
won&rsquo;t be here. I&rsquo;ll be in the garden.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Sinking back again.</i>] Yes. Go.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Kisses him swiftly.</i>] Thanks.</p>

<p>[<i>He runs out quickly by the door at the back leading into the
garden. <span class="charname">Bertha</span> enters by the door on the
left. She approaches the table and stands beside it, fingering the
petals of the roses, looking at <span
class="charname">Richard</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Watching her.</i>] Well?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Absently.</i>] Well. He says he likes me.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Leans his chin in his hand.</i>] You showed him his note?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes. I asked him what it meant.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
What did he say it meant?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He said I must know. I said I had an idea. Then he told me he liked me
very much. That I was beautiful&mdash;and all that.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Since when!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Again absently.</i>] Since when&mdash;what?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Since when did he say he liked you?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Always, he said. But more since we came back. He said I was like the
moon in this lavender dress. [<i>Looking at him.</i>] Had you any words
with him&mdash;about me?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Blandly.</i>] The usual thing. Not about you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He was very nervous. You saw that?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes. I saw it. What else went on?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He asked me to give him my hand.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Smiling.</i>] In marriage?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Smiling.</i>] No, only to hold.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Did you?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes. [<i>Tearing off a few petals.</i>] Then he caressed my hand and
asked would I let him kiss it. I let him.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Well?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Then he asked could he embrace me&mdash;even once?... And then...</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
And then?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He put his arm round me.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Stares at the floor for a moment, then looks at her again.</i>] And
then?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He said I had beautiful eyes. And asked could he kiss them. [<i>With a
gesture.</i>] I said: <i>Do so.</i></p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
And he did?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes. First one and then the other. [<i>She breaks off suddenly.</i>]
Tell me, Dick, does all this disturb you? Because I told you I
don&rsquo;t want that. I think you are only pretending you don&rsquo;t
mind. I don&rsquo;t mind.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Quietly.</i>] I know, dear. But I want to find out what he means or
feels just as you do.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Points at him.</i>] Remember, you allowed me to go on. I told you
the whole thing from the beginning.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>As before.</i>] I know, dear... And then?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He asked for a kiss. I said: <i>Take it.</i></p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
And then?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Crumpling a handful of petals.</i>] He kissed me.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Your mouth?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Once or twice.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Long kisses?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Fairly long. [<i>Reflects.</i>] Yes, the last time.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Rubs his hands slowly; then.</i>] With his lips? Or... the other
way?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes, the last time.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Did he ask you to kiss him?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He did.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Did you?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Hesitates, then looking straight at him.</i>] I did. I kissed
him.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
What way?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>With a shrug.</i>] O simply.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Were you excited?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Well, you can imagine. [<i>Frowning suddenly.</i>] Not much. He has not
nice lips... Still I was excited, of course. But not like with you,
Dick.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Was he?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Excited? Yes, I think he was. He sighed. He was dreadfully nervous.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Resting his forehead on his hand.</i>] I see.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Crosses towards the lounge and stands near him.</i>] Are you
jealous?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>As before.</i>] No.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Quietly.</i>] You are, Dick.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I am not. Jealous of what?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Because he kissed me.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Looks up.</i>] Is that all?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes, that&rsquo;s all. Except that he asked me would I meet him.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Out somewhere?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No. In his house.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Surprised.</i>] Over there with his mother, is it?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No, a house he has. He wrote the address for me.</p>

<p>[<i>She goes to the desk, takes the key from the flower vase, unlocks
the drawer and returns to him with the slip of paper.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Half to himself.</i>] Our cottage.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Hands him the slip.</i>] Here.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Reads it.</i>] Yes. Our cottage.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Your...?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
No, his. I call it ours. [<i>Looking at her.</i>] The cottage I told you
about so often&mdash;that we had the two keys for, he and I. It is his
now. Where we used to hold our wild nights, talking, drinking,
planning&mdash;at that time. Wild nights; yes. He and I together. [<i>He
throws the slip on the couch and rises suddenly.</i>] And sometimes I
alone. [<i>Stares at her.</i>] But not quite alone. I told you. You
remember?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Shocked.</i>] That place?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Walks away from her a few paces and stands still, thinking, holding
his chin.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Taking up the slip again.</i>] Where is it?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Do you not know?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He told me to take the tram at Lansdowne Road and to ask the man to let
me down there. Is it... is it a bad place?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
O no, cottages. [<i>He returns to the lounge and sits down.</i>] What
answer did you give?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No answer. He said he would wait.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Tonight?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Every night, he said. Between eight and nine.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
And so I am to go tonight to interview&mdash;the professor. About the
appointment I am to beg for. [<i>Looking at her.</i>] The interview is
arranged for tonight by him&mdash;between eight and nine. Curious,
isn&rsquo;t it? The same hour.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Very.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Did he ask you had I any suspicion?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Did he mention my name?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Not once?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Not that I remember.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Bounding to his feet.</i>] O yes! Quite clear!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
What?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Striding to and fro.</i>] A liar, a thief, and a fool! Quite clear!
A common thief! What else? [<i>With a harsh laugh.</i>] My great friend!
A patriot too! A thief&mdash;nothing else! [<i>He halts, thrusting his
hands into his pockets.</i>] But a fool also!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looking at him.</i>] What are you going to do?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Shortly.</i>] Follow him. Find him. Tell him. [<i>Calmly.</i>] A few
words will do. Thief and fool.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Flings the slip on the couch.</i>] I see it all!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Turning.</i>] Eh!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Hotly.</i>] The work of a devil.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
He?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Turning on him.</i>] No, you! The work of a devil to turn him
against me as you tried to turn my own child against me. Only you did
not succeed.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
How? In God&rsquo;s name, how?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Excitedly.</i>] Yes, yes. What I say. Everyone saw it. Whenever I
tried to correct him for the least thing you went on with your folly,
speaking to him as if he were a grownup man. Ruining the poor child, or
trying to. Then, of course, I was the cruel mother and only you loved
him. [<i>With growing excitement.</i>] But you did not turn him against
me&mdash;against his own mother. Because why? Because the child has too
much nature in him.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I never tried to do such a thing, Bertha. You know I cannot be severe
with a child.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Because you never loved your own mother. A mother is always a mother, no
matter what. I never heard of any human being that did not love the
mother that brought him into the world, except you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Approaching her quietly.</i>] Bertha, do not say things you will be
sorry for. Are you not glad my son is fond of me?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Who taught him to be? Who taught him to run to meet you? Who told him
you would bring him home toys when you were out on your rambles in the
rain, forgetting all about him&mdash;and me? I did. I taught him to love
you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes, dear. I know it was you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Almost crying.</i>] And then you try to turn everyone against me.
All is to be for you. I am to appear false and cruel to everyone except
to you. Because you take advantage of my simplicity as you did&mdash;the
first time.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Violently.</i>] And you have the courage to say that to me?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Facing him.</i>] Yes, I have! Both then and now. Because I am simple
you think you can do what you like with me. [<i>Gesticulating.</i>]
Follow him now. Call him names. Make him be humble before you and make
him despise me. Follow him!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Controlling himself.</i>] You forget that I have allowed you
complete liberty&mdash;and allow you it still.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Scornfully.</i>] Liberty!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes, complete. But he must know that I know. [<i>More calmly.</i>] I
will speak to him quietly. [<i>Appealing.</i>] Bertha, believe me, dear!
It is not jealousy. You have complete liberty to do as you
wish&mdash;you and he. But not in this way. He will not despise you. You
don&rsquo;t wish to deceive me or to pretend to deceive me&mdash;with
him, do you?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No, I do not. [<i>Looking full at him.</i>] Which of us two is the
deceiver?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Of us? You and me?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>In a calm decided tone.</i>] I know why you have allowed me what you
call complete liberty.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Why?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
To have complete liberty with&mdash;that girl.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Irritated.</i>] But, good God, you knew about that this long time. I
never hid it.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
You did. I thought it was a kind of friendship between you&mdash;till we
came back, and then I saw.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
So it is, Bertha.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Shakes her head.</i>] No, no. It is much more; and that is why you
give me complete liberty. All those things you sit up at night to write
about [<i>pointing to the study</i>] in there&mdash;about her. You call
that friendship?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Believe me, Bertha dear. Believe me as I believe you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>With an impulsive gesture.</i>] My God, I feel it! I know it! What
else is between you but love?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Calmly.</i>] You are trying to put that idea into my head but I warn
you that I don&rsquo;t take my ideas from other people.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Hotly.</i>] It is, it is! And that is why you allow him to go on. Of
course! It doesn&rsquo;t affect you. You love her.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Love! [<i>Throws out his hands with a sigh and moves away from her.</i>]
I cannot argue with you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
You can&rsquo;t because I am right. [<i>Following him a few steps.</i>]
What would anyone say?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Turns to her.</i>] Do you think I care?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
But I care. What would he say if he knew? You, who talk so much of the
high kind of feeling you have for me, expressing yourself in that way to
another woman. If he did it, or other men, I could understand because
they are false pretenders. But you, Dick! Why do you not tell him
then?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
You can if you like.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I will. Certainly I will.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Coolly.</i>] He will explain it to you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He doesn&rsquo;t say one thing and do another. He is honest in his own
way.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Plucks one of the roses and throws it at her feet.</i>] He is,
indeed! The soul of honour!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
You may make fun of him as much as you like. I understand more than you
think about that business. And so will he. Writing those long letters to
her for years, and she to you. For years. But since I came back I
understand it&mdash;well.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
You do not. Nor would he.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Laughs scornfully.</i>] Of course. Neither he nor I can understand
it. Only she can. Because it is such a deep thing!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Angrily.</i>] Neither he nor you&mdash;nor she either! Not one of
you!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>With great bitterness.</i>] She will! She will understand it! The
diseased woman!</p>

<p>[<i>She turns away and walks over to the little table on the right.
<span class="charname">Richard</span> restrains a sudden gesture. A
short pause.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Gravely.</i>] Bertha, take care of uttering words like that!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Turning, excitedly.</i>] I don&rsquo;t mean any harm! I feel for her
more than you can because I am a woman. I do, sincerely. But what I say
is true.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Is it generous? Think.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Pointing towards the garden.</i>] It is she who is not generous.
Remember now what I say.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
What?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Comes nearer; in a calmer tone.</i>] You have given that woman very
much, Dick. And she may be worthy of it. And she may understand it all,
too. I know she is that kind.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Do you believe that?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I do. But I believe you will get very little from her in return&mdash;or
from any of her clan. Remember my words, Dick. Because she is not
generous and they are not generous. Is it all wrong what I am saying? Is
it?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Darkly.</i>] No. Not all.</p>

<p>[<i>She stoops and, picking up the rose from the floor, places it in
the vase again. He watches her. <span class="charname">Brigid</span>
appears at the folding doors on the right.</i>]</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
The tea is on the table, ma&rsquo;am.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Very well.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
Is Master Archie in the garden?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes. Call him in.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Brigid</span> crosses the room and goes
out into the garden. <span class="charname">Bertha</span> goes towards
the doors on the right. At the lounge she stops and takes up the
slip.</i>]</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>In the garden.</i>] Master Archie! You are to come in to your
tea.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Am I to go to this place?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Do you want to go?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I want to find out what he means. Am I to go?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Why do you ask me? Decide yourself.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Do you tell me to go?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
No.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Do you forbid me to go?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
No.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>From the garden.</i>] Come quickly, Master Archie! Your tea is
waiting on you.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Brigid</span> crosses the room and goes
out through the folding doors. <span class="charname">Bertha</span>
folds the slip into the waist of her dress and goes slowly towards the
right. Near the door she turns and halts.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Tell me not to go and I will not.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Without looking at her.</i>] Decide yourself.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Will you blame me then?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Excitedly.</i>] No, no! I will not blame you. You are free. I cannot
blame you.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Archie</span> appears at the garden
door.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I did not deceive you.</p>

<p>[<i>She goes out through the folding doors. <span
class="charname">Richard</span> remains standing at the table. <span
class="charname">Archie</span>, when his mother has gone, runs down to
<span class="charname">Richard</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Quickly.</i>] Well, did you ask her?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Starting.</i>] What?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Can I go?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
In the morning? She said yes?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes. In the morning.</p>

him fondly.</i>]</p>

<h3><b>Second Act</b></h3>

<p><i>A room in Robert Hand&rsquo;s cottage at Ranelagh. On the right,
forward, a small black piano, on the rest of which is an open piece of
music. Farther back a door leading to the street door. In the wall, at
the back, folding doors, draped with dark curtains, leading to a
bedroom. Near the piano a large table, on which is a tall oil lamp with
a wide yellow shade. Chairs, upholstered, near this table. A small
cardtable more forward. Against the back wall a bookcase. In the left
wall, back, a window looking out into the garden, and, forward, a door
and porch, also leading to the garden. Easychairs here and there. Plants
in the porch and near the draped folding doors. On the walls are many
framed black and white designs. In the right corner, back, a sideboard;
and in the centre of the room, left of the table, a group consisting of
a standing Turkish pipe, a low oil stove, which is not lit, and a
rocking-chair. It is the evening of the same day.</i></p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Robert Hand</span>, in evening dress, is
seated at the piano. The candles are not lit but the lamp on the table
is lit. He plays softly in the bass the first bars of Wolfram&rsquo;s
song in the last act of &lsquo;Tannhäuser&rsquo;. Then he breaks off
and, resting an elbow on the ledge of the keyboard, meditates. Then he
rises and, pulling out a pump from behind the piano, walks here and
there in the room ejecting from it into the air sprays of perfume. He
inhales the air slowly and then puts the pump back behind the piano. He
sits down on a chair near the table and, smoothing his hair carefully,
sighs once or twice. Then, thrusting his hands into his trousers
pockets, he leans back, stretches out his legs, and waits. A knock is
heard at the street door. He rises quickly.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Exclaims.</i>] Bertha!</p>

<p>[<i>He hurries out by the door on the right. There is a noise of
confused greeting. After a few moments <span
class="charname">Robert</span> enters, followed by <span
class="charname">Richard Rowan</span>, who is in grey tweeds as before
but holds in one hand a dark felt hat and in the other an
umbrella.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
First of all let me put these outside.</p>

<p>[<i>He takes the hat and umbrella, leaves them in the hall and
returns.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Pulling round a chair.</i>] Here you are. You are lucky to find me
in. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me today? You were always a devil for
surprises. I suppose my evocation of the past was too much for your wild
blood. See how artistic I have become. [<i>He points to the walls.</i>]
The piano is an addition since your time. I was just strumming out
Wagner when you came. Killing time. You see I am ready for the fray.
[<i>Laughs.</i>] I was just wondering how you and the vicechancellor
were getting on together. [<i>With exaggerated alarm.</i>] But are you
going in that suit? O well, it doesn&rsquo;t make much odds, I suppose.
But how goes the time? [<i>He takes out his watch.</i>] Twenty past
eight already, I declare!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Have you an appointment?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Laughs nervously.</i>] Suspicious to the last!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Then I may sit down?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Of course, of course. [<i>They both sit down.</i>] For a few minutes,
anyhow. Then we can both go on together. We are not bound for time.
Between eight and nine, he said, didn&rsquo;t he? What time is it, I
wonder? [<i>Is about to look again at his watch; then stops.</i>] Twenty
past eight, yes.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Wearily, sadly.</i>] Your appointment also was for the same hour.
Here.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
What appointment?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
With Bertha.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Stares at him.</i>] Are you mad?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Are you?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>After a long pause.</i>] Who told you?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
She.</p>

<p>[<i>A short silence.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>In a low voice.</i>] Yes. I must have been mad. [<i>Rapidly.</i>]
Listen to me, Richard. It is a great relief to me that you have
come&mdash;the greatest relief. I assure you that ever since this
afternoon I have thought and thought how I could break it off without
seeming a fool. A great relief! I even intended to send word... a
letter, a few lines. [<i>Suddenly.</i>] But then it was too late...
[<i>Passes his hand over his forehead.</i>] Let me speak frankly with
you; let me tell you everything.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I know everything. I have known for some time.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Since when?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Since it began between you and her.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Again rapidly.</i>] Yes, I was mad. But it was merely
lightheadedness. I admit that to have asked her here this evening was a
mistake. I can explain everything to you. And I will. Truly.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Explain to me what is the word you longed and never dared to say to her.
If you can or will.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Looks down, then raises his head.</i>] Yes. I will. I admire very
much the personality of your... of... your wife. That is the word. I can
say it. It is no secret.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Then why did you wish to keep secret your wooing?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Wooing?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Your advances to her, little by little, day after day, looks, whispers.
[<i>With a nervous movement of the hands.</i>] <i>Insomma</i>,
wooing.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Bewildered.</i>] But how do you know all this?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
She told me.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
This afternoon?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
No. Time after time, as it happened.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
You knew? From her? [<i><span class="charname">Richard</span>
nods.</i>]. You were watching us all the time?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Very coldly.</i>] I was watching you.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Quickly.</i>] I mean, watching me. And you never spoke! You had only
to speak a word&mdash;to save me from myself. You were trying me.
[<i>Passes his hand again over his forehead.</i>] It was a terrible
trial: now also. [<i>Desperately.</i>] Well, it is past. It will be a
lesson to me for all my life. You hate me now for what I have done and
for...</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Quietly, looking at him.</i>] Have I said that I hate you?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Do you not? You must.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Even if Bertha had not told me I should have known. Did you not see that
when I came in this afternoon I went into my study suddenly for a
moment?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
You did. I remember.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
To give you time to recover yourself. It made me sad to see your eyes.
And the roses too. I cannot say why. A great mass of overblown
roses.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I thought I had to give them. Was that strange? [<i>Looks at
<span class="charname">Richard</span> with a tortured expression.</i>]
Too many, perhaps? Or too old or common?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
That was why I did not hate you. The whole thing made me sad all at
once.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>To himself.</i>] And this is real. It is happening&mdash;to us.</p>

<p>[<i>He stares before him for some moments in silence, as if dazed;
then, without turning his head, continues.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
And she, too, was trying me; making an experiment with me for your
sake!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
You know women better than I do. She says she felt pity for you.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Brooding.</i>] Pitied me, because I am no longer... an ideal lover.
Like my roses. Common, old.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Like all men you have a foolish wandering heart.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Slowly.</i>] Well, you spoke at last. You chose the right
moment.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Leans forward.</i>] Robert, not like this. For us two, no. Years, a
whole life, of friendship. Think a moment. Since childhood, boyhood...
No, no. Not in such a way&mdash;like thieves&mdash;at night.
[<i>Glancing about him.</i>] And in such a place. No, Robert, that is
not for people like us.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
What a lesson! Richard, I cannot tell you what a relief it is to me that
you have spoken&mdash;that the danger is passed. Yes, yes. [<i>Somewhat
diffidently.</i>] Because... there was some danger for you, too, if you
think. Was there not?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
What danger?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>In the same tone.</i>] I don&rsquo;t know. I mean if you had not
spoken. If you had watched and waited on until...</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Until?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Bravely.</i>] Until I had come to like her more and more (because I
can assure you it is only a lightheaded idea of mine), to like her
deeply, to love her. Would you have spoken to me then as you have just
now? [<i><span class="charname">Richard</span> is silent. <span
class="charname">Robert</span> goes on more boldly.</i>] It would have
been different, would it not? For then it might have been too late while
it is not too late now. What could I have said then? I could have said
only: You are my friend, my dear good friend. I am very sorry but I love
her. [<i>With a sudden fervent gesture.</i>] I love her and I will take
her from you, however I can, because I love her.</p>

<p>[<i>They look at each other for some moments in silence.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Calmly.</i>] That is the language I have heard often and never
believed in. Do you mean by stealth or by violence? Steal you could not
in my house because the doors were open; nor take by violence if there
were no resistance.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
You forget that the kingdom of heaven suffers violence: and the kingdom
of heaven is like a woman.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Smiling.</i>] Go on.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Diffidently, but bravely.</i>] Do you think you have rights over
her&mdash;over her heart?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
None.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
For what you have done for her? So much! You claim nothing?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Nothing.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>After a pause strikes his forehead with his hand.</i>] What am I
saying? Or what am I thinking? I wish you would upbraid me, curse me,
hate me as I deserve. You love this woman. I remember all you told me
long ago. She is yours, your work. [<i>Suddenly.</i>] And that is why I,
too, was drawn to her. You are so strong that you attract me even
through her.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I am weak.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>With enthusiasm.</i>] You, Richard! You are the incarnation of
strength.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Holds out his hands.</i>] Feel those hands.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Taking his hands.</i>] Yes. Mine are stronger. But I meant strength
of another kind.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Gloomily.</i>] I think you would try to take her by violence.</p>

<p>[<i>He withdraws his hands slowly.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Rapidly.</i>] Those are moments of sheer madness when we feel an
intense passion for a woman. We see nothing. We think of nothing. Only
to possess her. Call it brutal, bestial, what you will.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>A little timidly.</i>] I am afraid that that longing to possess a
woman is not love.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Impatiently.</i>] No man ever yet lived on this earth who did not
long to possess&mdash;I mean to possess in the flesh&mdash;the woman
whom he loves. It is nature&rsquo;s law.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Contemptuously.</i>] What is that to me? Did I vote it?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
But if you love... What else is it?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Hesitatingly.</i>] To wish her well.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Warmly.</i>] But the passion which burns us night and day to possess
her. You feel it as I do. And it is not what you said now.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Have you...? [<i>He stops for an instance.</i>] Have you the luminous
certitude that yours is the brain in contact with which she must think
and understand and that yours is the body in contact with which her body
must feel? Have you this certitude in yourself?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Have you?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Moved.</i>] Once I had it, Robert: a certitude as luminous as that
of my own existence&mdash;or an illusion as luminous.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Cautiously.</i>] And now?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
If you had it and I could feel that you had it&mdash;even now...</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
What would you do?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Quietly.</i>] Go away. You, and not I, would be necessary to her.
Alone as I was before I met her.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Rubs his hands nervously.</i>] A nice little load on my
conscience!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Abstractedly.</i>] You met my son when you came to my house this
afternoon. He told me. What did you feel?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Promptly.</i>] Pleasure.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Nothing else?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Nothing else. Unless I thought of two things at the same time. I am like
that. If my best friend lay in his coffin and his face had a comic
expression I should smile. [<i>With a little gesture of despair.</i>] I
am like that. But I should suffer too, deeply.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
You spoke of conscience... Did he seem to you a child only&mdash;or an
angel?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Shakes his head.</i>] No. Neither an angel nor an Anglo-Saxon. Two
things, by the way, for which I have very little sympathy.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Never then? Never even... with her? Tell me. I wish to know.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I feel in my heart something different. I believe that on the last day
(if it ever comes), when we are all assembled together, that the
Almighty will speak to us like this. We will say that we lived chastely
with one other creature...</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Bitterly.</i>] Lie to Him?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Or that we tried to. And He will say to us: Fools! Who told you that you
were to give yourselves to one being only? You were made to give
yourselves to many freely. I wrote that law with My finger on your
hearts.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
On woman&rsquo;s heart, too?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes. Can we close our heart against an affection which we feel deeply?
Should we close it? Should she?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
We are speaking of bodily union.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Affection between man and woman must come to that. We think too much of
it because our minds are warped. For us today it is of no more
consequence than any other form of contact&mdash;than a kiss.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
If it is of no consequence why are you dissatisfied till you reach that
end? Why were you waiting here tonight?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Passion tends to go as far as it can; but, you may believe me or not, I
had not that in my mind&mdash;to reach that end.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Reach it if you can. I will use no arm against you that the world puts
in my hand. If the law which God&rsquo;s finger has written on our
hearts is the law you say I too am God&rsquo;s creature.</p>

<p>[<i>He rises and paces to and fro some moments in silence. Then he
goes towards the porch and leans against the jamb. <span
class="charname">Robert</span> watches him.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I always felt it. In myself and in others.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Absently.</i>] Yes?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>With a vague gesture.</i>] For all. That a woman, too, has the right
to try with many men until she finds love. An immoral idea, is it not? I
wanted to write a book about it. I began it...</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>As before.</i>] Yes?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Because I knew a woman who seemed to me to be doing that&mdash;carrying
out that idea in her own life. She interested me very much.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
When was this?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
O, not lately. When you were away.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Richard</span> leaves his place rather
abruptly and again paces to and fro.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
You see, I am more honest than you thought.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I wish you had not thought of her now&mdash;whoever she was, or is.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Easily.</i>] She was and is the wife of a stockbroker.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Turning.</i>] You know him?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Intimately.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Richard</span> sits down again in the same
place and leans forward, his head on his hands.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Moving his chair a little closer.</i>] May I ask you a question?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
You may.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>With some hesitation.</i>] Has it never happened to you in these
years&mdash;I mean when you were away from her, perhaps, or
travelling&mdash;to... betray her with another. Betray her, I mean, not
in love. Carnally, I mean... Has that never happened?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
It has.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
And what did you do?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>As before.</i>] I remember the first time. I came home. It was
night. My house was silent. My little son was sleeping in his cot. She,
too, was asleep. I wakened her from sleep and told her. I cried beside
her bed; and I pierced her heart.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
O, Richard, why did you do that?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Betray her?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
No. But tell her, waken her from sleep to tell her. It was piercing her
heart.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
She must know me as I am.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
But that is not you as you are. A moment of weakness.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Lost in thought.</i>] And I was feeding the flame of her innocence
with my guilt.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Brusquely.</i>] O, don&rsquo;t talk of guilt and innocence. You have
made her all that she is. A strange and wonderful personality&mdash;in
my eyes, at least.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Darkly.</i>] Or I have killed her.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Killed her?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
The virginity of her soul.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Well lost! What would she be without you?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I tried to give her a new life.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
And you have. A new and rich life.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Is it worth what I have taken from her&mdash;her girlhood, her laughter,
her young beauty, the hopes in her young heart?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Firmly.</i>] Yes. Well worth it. [<i>He looks at <span
class="charname">Richard</span> for some moments in silence.</i>] If you
had neglected her, lived wildly, brought her away so far only to make
her suffer...</p>

<p>[<i>He stops. <span class="charname">Richard</span> raises his head
and looks at him.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
If I had?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Slightly confused.</i>] You know there were rumours here of your
life abroad&mdash;a wild life. Some persons who knew you or met you or
heard of you in Rome. Lying rumours.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Coldly.</i>] Continue.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Laughs a little harshly.</i>] Even I at times thought of her as a
victim. [<i>Smoothly.</i>] And of course, Richard, I felt and knew all
the time that you were a man of great talent&mdash;of something more
than talent. And that was your excuse&mdash;a valid one in my eyes.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Have you thought that it is perhaps now&mdash;at this moment&mdash;that
I am neglecting her? [<i>He clasps his hands nervously and leans across
toward <span class="charname">Robert</span>.</i>] I may be silent still.
And she may yield to you at last&mdash;wholly and many times.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Draws back at once.</i>] My dear Richard, my dear friend, I swear to
you I could not make you suffer.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Continuing.</i>] You may then know in soul and body, in a hundred
forms, and ever restlessly, what some old theologian, Duns Scotus, I
think, called a death of the spirit.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Eagerly.</i>] A death. No; its affirmation! A death! The supreme
instant of life from which all coming life proceeds, the eternal law of
nature herself.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
And that other law of nature, as you call it: change. How will it be
when you turn against her and against me; when her beauty, or what seems
so to you now, wearies you and my affection for you seems false and
odious?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
That will never be. Never.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
And you turn even against yourself for having known me or trafficked
with us both?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Gravely.</i>] It will never be like that, Richard. Be sure of
that.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Contemptuously.</i>] I care very little whether it is or not because
there is something I fear much more.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Shakes his head.</i>] You fear? I disbelieve you, Richard. Since we
were boys together I have followed your mind. You do not know what moral
fear is.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Lays his hand on his arm.</i>] Listen. She is dead. She lies on my
bed. I look at her body which I betrayed&mdash;grossly and many times.
And loved, too, and wept over. And I know that her body was always my
loyal slave. To me, to me only she gave... [<i>He breaks off and turns
aside, unable to speak.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Softly.</i>] Do not suffer, Richard. There is no need. She is loyal
to you, body and soul. Why do you fear?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Turns towards him, almost fiercely.</i>] Not that fear. But that I
will reproach myself then for having taken all for myself because I
would not suffer her to give to another what was hers and not mine to
give, because I accepted from her her loyalty and made her life poorer
in love. That is my fear. That I stand between her and any moments of
life that should be hers, between her and you, between her and anyone,
between her and anything. I will not do it. I cannot and I will not. I
dare not.</p>

<p>[<i>He leans back in his chair breathless, with shining eyes.
<span class="charname">Robert</span> rises quietly, and stands behind
his chair.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Look here, Richard. We have said all there is to be said. Let the past
be past.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Quickly and harshly.</i>] Wait. One thing more. For you, too, must
know me as I am&mdash;now.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
More? Is there more?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I told you that when I saw your eyes this afternoon I felt sad. Your
humility and confusion, I felt, united you to me in brotherhood. [<i>He
turns half round towards him.</i>] At that moment I felt our whole life
together in the past, and I longed to put my arm around your neck.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Deeply and suddenly touched.</i>] It is noble of you, Richard, to
forgive me like this.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Struggling with himself.</i>] I told you that I wished you not to do
anything false and secret against me&mdash;against our friendship,
against her; not to steal her from me craftily, secretly,
meanly&mdash;in the dark, in the night&mdash;you, Robert, my friend.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I know. And it was noble of you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Looks up at him with a steady gaze.</i>] No. Not noble. Ignoble.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Makes an involuntary gesture.</i>] How? Why?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Looks away again: in a lower voice.</i>] That is what I must tell
you too. Because in the very core of my ignoble heart I longed to be
betrayed by you and by her&mdash;in the dark, in the
night&mdash;secretly, meanly, craftily. By you, my best friend, and by
her. I longed for that passionately and ignobly, to be dishonoured for
ever in love and in lust, to be...</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Bending down, places his hands over <span
class="charname">Richard&rsquo;s</span> mouth.</i>] Enough. Enough.
[<i>He takes his hands away.</i>] But no. Go on.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
To be for ever a shameful creature and to build up my soul again out of
the ruins of its shame.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
And that is why you wished that she...</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>With calm.</i>] She has spoken always of her innocence, as I have
spoken always of my guilt, humbling me.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
From pride, then?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
From pride and from ignoble longing. And from a motive deeper still.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>With decision.</i>] I understand you.</p>

<p>[<i>He returns to his place and begins to speak at once, drawing his
chair closer.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
May it not be that we are here and now in the presence of a moment which
will free us both&mdash;me as well as you&mdash;from the last bonds of
what is called morality. My friendship for you has laid bonds on me.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Light bonds, apparently.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I acted in the dark, secretly. I will do so no longer. Have you the
courage to allow me to act freely?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
A duel&mdash;between us?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>With growing excitement.</i>] A battle of both our souls, different
as they are, against all that is false in them and in the world. A
battle of your soul against the spectre of fidelity, of mine against the
spectre of friendship. All life is a conquest, the victory of human
passion over the commandments of cowardice. Will you, Richard? Have you
the courage? Even if it shatters to atoms the friendship between us,
even if it breaks up for ever the last illusion in your own life? There
was an eternity before we were born: another will come after we are
dead. The blinding instant of passion alone&mdash;passion, free,
unashamed, irresistible&mdash;that is the only gate by which we can
escape from the misery of what slaves call life. Is not this the
language of your own youth that I heard so often from you in this very
place where we are sitting now? Have you changed?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Passes his hand across his brow.</i>] Yes. It is the language of my
youth.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Eagerly, intensely.</i>] Richard, you have driven me up to this
point. She and I have only obeyed your will. You yourself have roused
these words in my brain. Your own words. Shall we? Freely? Together?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Mastering his emotion.</i>] Together no. Fight your part alone. I
will not free you. Leave me to fight mine.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Rises, decided.</i>] You allow me, then?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Rises also, calmly.</i>] Free yourself.</p>

<p>[<i>A knock is heard at the hall door.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>In alarm.</i>] What does this mean?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Calmly.</i>] Bertha, evidently. Did you not ask her to come?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes, but... [<i>Looking about him.</i>] Then I am going, Richard.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
No. I am going.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Desperately.</i>] Richard, I appeal to you. Let me go. It is over.
She is yours. Keep her and forgive me, both of you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Because you are generous enough to allow me?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Hotly.</i>] Richard, you will make me angry with you if you say
that.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Angry or not, I will not live on your generosity. You have asked her to
meet you here tonight and alone. Solve the question between you.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Promptly.</i>] Open the door. I shall wait in the garden. [<i>He
goes towards the porch.</i>] Explain to her, Richard, as best you can. I
cannot see her now.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I shall go. I tell you. Wait out there if you wish.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out by the door on the right. <span
class="charname">Robert</span> goes out hastily through the porch but
comes back the same instant.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
An umbrella! [<i>With a sudden gesture.</i>] O!</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out again through the porch. The hall door is heard to
open and close. <span class="charname">Richard</span> enters, followed
by <span class="charname">Bertha</span>, who is dressed in a darkbrown
costume and wears a small dark red hat. She has neither umbrella nor
waterproof.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Gaily.</i>] Welcome back to old Ireland!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Nervously, seriously.</i>] Is this the place?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes, it is. How did you find it?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I told the cabman. I didn&rsquo;t like to ask my way. [<i>Looking about
her curiously.</i>] Was he not waiting? Has he gone away?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Points towards the garden.</i>] He is waiting. Out there. He was
waiting when I came.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Selfpossessed again.</i>] You see, you came after all.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Did you think I would not?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I knew you could not remain away. You see, after all you are like all
other men. You had to come. You are jealous like the others.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
You seem annoyed to find me here.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
What happened between you?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I told him I knew everything, that I had known for a long time. He asked
how. I said from you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Does he hate me?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I cannot read in his heart.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Sits down helplessly.</i>] Yes. He hates me. He believes I made a
fool of him&mdash;betrayed him. I knew he would.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I told him you were sincere with him.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He does not believe it. Nobody would believe it. I should have told him
first&mdash;not you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I thought he was a common robber, prepared to use even violence against
you. I had to protect you from that.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
That I could have done myself.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Are you sure?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
It would have been enough to have told him that you knew I was here. Now
I can find out nothing. He hates me. He is right to hate me. I have
treated him badly, shamefully.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Takes her hand.</i>] Bertha, look at me.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Turns to him.</i>] Well?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Gazes into her eyes and then lets her hand fall.</i>] I cannot read
in your heart either.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Still looking at him.</i>] You could not remain away. Do you not
trust me? You can see I am quite calm. I could have hidden it all from
you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I doubt that.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>With a slight toss of her head.</i>] O, easily if I had wanted
to.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Darkly.</i>] Perhaps you are sorry now that you did not.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Perhaps I am.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Unpleasantly.</i>] What a fool you were to tell me! It would have
been so nice if you had kept it secret.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
As you do, no?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
As I do, yes. [<i>He turns to go.</i>] Goodbye for a while.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Alarmed, rises.</i>] Are you going?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Naturally. My part is ended here.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
To her, I suppose?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Astonished.</i>] Who?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Her ladyship. I suppose it is all planned so that you may have a good
opportunity. To meet her and have an intellectual conversation!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>With an outburst of rude anger.</i>] To meet the devil&rsquo;s
father!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Unpins her hat and sits down.</i>] Very well. You can go. Now I know
what to do.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Returns, approaches her.</i>] You don&rsquo;t believe a word of what
you say.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Calmly.</i>] You can go. Why don&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Then you have come here and led him on in this way on account of me. Is
that how it is?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
There is one person in all this who is not a fool. And that is you. I am
though. And he is.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Continuing.</i>] If so you have indeed treated him badly and
shamefully.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Points at him.</i>] Yes. But it was your fault. And I will end it
now. I am simply a tool for you. You have no respect for me. You never
had because I did what I did.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
And has he respect?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He has. Of all the persons I met since I came back he is the only one
who has. And he knows what they only suspect. And that is why I liked
him from the first and like him still. Great respect for me she has! Why
did you not ask her to come away with you nine years ago?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
You know why, Bertha. Ask yourself.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes, I know why. You knew the answer you would get. That is why.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
That is not why. I did not even ask you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes. You knew I would go, asked or not. I do things. But if I do one
thing I can do two things. As I have the name I can have the gains.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>With increasing excitement.</i>] Bertha, I accept what is to be. I
have trusted you. I will trust you still.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
To have that against me. To leave me then. [<i>Almost passionately.</i>]
Why do you not defend me then against him? Why do you go away from me
now without a word? Dick, my God, tell me what you wish me to do?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I cannot, dear. [<i>Struggling with himself.</i>] Your own heart will
tell you. [<i>He seizes both her hands.</i>] I have a wild delight in my
soul, Bertha, as I look at you. I see you as you are yourself. That I
came first in your life or before him then&mdash;that may be nothing to
you. You may be his more than mine.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I am not. Only I feel for him, too.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
And I do too. You may be his and mine. I will trust you, Bertha, and him
too. I must. I cannot hate him since his arms have been around you. You
have drawn us near together. There is something wiser than wisdom in
your heart. Who am I that I should call myself master of your heart or
of any woman&rsquo;s? Bertha, love him, be his, give yourself to him if
you desire&mdash;or if you can.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Dreamily.</i>] I will remain.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Goodbye.</p>

<p>[<i>He lets her hand fall and goes out rapidly on the right.

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Catching sight of him, starts back: then, quickly.</i>] Robert!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Are you alone?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Looking towards the door on the right.</i>] Where is he?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Gone. [<i>Nervously.</i>] You startled me. Where did you come from?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>With a movement of his head.</i>] Out there. Did he not tell you I
was out there&mdash;waiting?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Quickly.</i>] Yes, he told me. But I was afraid here alone. With the
door open, waiting. [<i>She comes to the table and rests her hand on the
corner.</i>] Why do you stand like that in the doorway?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Why? I am afraid too.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Of what?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Of you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looks down.</i>] Do you hate me now?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I fear you. [<i>Clasping his hands at his back, quietly but a little
defiantly.</i>] I fear a new torture&mdash;a new trap.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>As before.</i>] For what do you blame me?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Comes forward a few steps, halts: then impulsively:</i>] Why did you
lead me on? Day after day, more and more. Why did you not stop me? You
could have&mdash;with a word. But not even a word! I forgot myself and
him. You saw it. That I was ruining myself in his eyes, losing his
friendship. Did you want me to?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looking up.</i>] You never asked me.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Asked you what?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
If he suspected&mdash;or knew.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
And would you have told me?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Hesitatingly.</i>] Did you tell him&mdash;everything?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I did.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I mean&mdash;details.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Everything.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>With a forced smile.</i>] I see. You were making an experiment for
his sake. On me. Well, why not? It seems I was a good subject. Still, it
was a little cruel of you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Try to understand me, Robert. You must try.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>With a polite gesture.</i>] Well, I will try.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Why do you stand like that near the door? It makes me nervous to look at
you.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I am trying to understand. And then I am afraid.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Holds out her hand.</i>] You need not be afraid.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Robert</span> comes towards her quickly
and takes her hand.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Diffidently.</i>] Used you to laugh over me&mdash;together?
[<i>Drawing his hand away.</i>] But now I must be good or you may laugh
over me again&mdash;tonight.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Distressed, lays her hand on his arm.</i>] Please listen to me,
Robert... But you are all wet, drenched! [<i>She passes her hands over
his coat.</i>] O, you poor fellow! Out there in the rain all that time!
I forgot that.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Laughs.</i>] Yes, you forgot the climate.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
But you are really drenched. You must change your coat.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Takes her hands.</i>] Tell me, it is pity then that you feel for me,
as he&mdash;as Richard&mdash;says?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Please change your coat, Robert, when I ask you. You might get a very
bad cold from that. Do, please.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
What would it matter now?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looking round her.</i>] Where do you keep your clothes here?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Points to the door at the back.</i>] In there. I fancy I have a
jacket here. [<i>Maliciously.</i>] In my bedroom.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Well, go in and take that off.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
And you?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I will wait here for you.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Do you command me to?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Laughing.</i>] Yes, I command you.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Promptly.</i>] Then I will. [<i>He goes quickly towards the bedroom
door; then turns round.</i>] You won&rsquo;t go away?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No, I will wait. But don&rsquo;t be long.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Only a moment.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes into the bedroom, leaving the door open.
<span class="charname">Bertha</span> looks curiously about her and then
glances in indecision towards the door at the back.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>From the bedroom.</i>] You have not gone?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I am in the dark here. I must light the lamp.</p>

<p>[<i>He is heard striking a match, and putting a glass shade on a
lamp. A pink light comes in through the doorway. <span
class="charname">Bertha</span> glances at her watch at her wristlet and
then sits at the table.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>As before.</i>] Do you like the effect of the light?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
O, yes.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Can you admire it from where you are?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes, quite well.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
It was for you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Confused.</i>] I am not worthy even of that.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Clearly, harshly.</i>] Love&rsquo;s labour lost.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Rising nervously.</i>] Robert!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Come here, quickly! Quickly, I say!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I am ready.</p>

<p>[<i>He appears in the doorway, wearing a darkgreen velvet jacket.
Seeing her agitation, he comes quickly towards her.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
What is it, Bertha?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Trembling.</i>] I was afraid.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Of being alone?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Catches his hands.</i>] You know what I mean. My nerves are all
upset.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
That I...?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Promise me, Robert, not to think of such a thing. Never. If you like me
at all. I thought that moment...</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
What an idea?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
But promise me if you like me.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
If I like you, Bertha! I promise. Of course, I promise. You are
trembling all over.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Let me sit down somewhere. It will pass in a moment.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
My poor Bertha! Sit down. Come.</p>

<p>[<i>He leads her towards a chair near the table. She sits down. He
stands beside her.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>After a short pause.</i>] Has it passed?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes. It was only for a moment. I was very silly. I was afraid that... I
wanted to see you near me.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
That... that you made me promise not to think of?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Keenly.</i>] Or something else?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Helplessly.</i>] Robert, I feared something. I am not sure what.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
And now?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Now you are here. I can see you. Now it has passed.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>With resignation.</i>] Passed. Yes. Love&rsquo;s labour lost.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looks up at him.</i>] Listen, Robert. I want to explain to you about
that. I could not deceive Dick. Never. In nothing. I told him
everything&mdash;from the first. Then it went on and on; and still you
never spoke or asked me. I wanted you to.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Is that the truth, Bertha?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes, because it annoyed me that you could think I was like... like the
other women I suppose you knew that way. I think that Dick is right too.
Why should there be secrets?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Softly.</i>] Still, secrets can be very sweet. Can they not?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Smiles.</i>] Yes, I know they can. But, you see, I could not keep
things secret from Dick. Besides, what is the good? They always come out
in the end. Is it not better for people to know?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Softly and a little shyly.</i>] How could you, Bertha, tell him
everything? Did you? Every single thing that passed between us?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes. Everything he asked me.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Did he ask you&mdash;much?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
You know the kind he is. He asks about everything. The ins and outs.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
About our kissing, too?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Of course. I told him all.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Shakes his head slowly.</i>] Extraordinary little person! Were you
not ashamed?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Not a bit?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No. Why? Is that terrible?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
And how did he take it? Tell me. I want to know everything, too.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Laughs.</i>] It excited him. More than usual.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Why? Is he excitable&mdash;still?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Archly.</i>] Yes, very. When he is not lost in his philosophy.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
More than I?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
More than you? [<i>Reflecting.</i>] How could I answer that? You both
are, I suppose?</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Robert</span> turns aside and gazes
towards the porch, passing his hand once or twice thoughtfully over his
hair.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Gently.</i>] Are you angry with me again?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Moodily.</i>] You are with me.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No, Robert. Why should I be?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Because I asked you to come to this place. I tried to prepare it for
you. [<i>He points vaguely here and there.</i>] A sense of
quietness.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Touching his jacket with her fingers.</i>] And this, too. Your nice
velvet coat.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Also. I will keep no secrets from you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
You remind me of someone in a picture. I like you in it... But you are
not angry, are you?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Darkly.</i>] Yes. That was my mistake. To ask you to come here. I
felt it when I looked at you from the garden and saw you&mdash;you,
Bertha&mdash;standing here. [<i>Hopelessly.</i>] But what else could I
have done?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Quietly.</i>] You mean because others have been here?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>[<i>He walks away from her a few paces. A gust of wind makes the lamp
on the table flicker. He lowers the wick slightly.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Following him with her eyes.</i>] But I knew that before I came. I
am not angry with you for it.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Shrugs his shoulders.</i>] Why should you be angry with me after
all? You are not even angry with him&mdash;for the same thing&mdash;or
worse.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Did he tell you that about himself?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes. He told me. We all confess to one another here. Turn about.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I try to forget it.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
It does not trouble you?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Not now. Only I dislike to think of it.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
It is merely something brutal, you think? Of little importance?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
It does not trouble me&mdash;now.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Looking at her over his shoulder.</i>] But there is something that
would trouble you very much and that you would not try to forget?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
What?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Turning towards her.</i>] If it were not only something brutal with
this person or that&mdash;for a few moments. If it were something fine
and spiritual&mdash;with one person only&mdash;with one woman.
[<i>Smiles.</i>] And perhaps brutal too. It usually comes to that sooner
or later. Would you try to forget and forgive that?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Toying with her wristlet.</i>] In whom?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
In anyone. In me.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Calmly.</i>] You mean in Dick.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I said in myself. But would you?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
You think I would revenge myself? Is Dick not to be free too?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Points at her.</i>] That is not from your heart, Bertha.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Proudly.</i>] Yes, it is; let him be free too. He leaves me free
also.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Insistently.</i>] And you know why? And understand? And you like it?
And you want to be? And it makes you happy? And has made you happy?
Always? This gift of freedom which he gave you&mdash;nine years ago?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Gazing at him with wide open eyes.</i>] But why do you ask me such a
lot of questions, Robert?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Stretches out both hands to her.</i>] Because I had another gift to
offer you then&mdash;a common simple gift&mdash;like myself. If you want
to know it I will tell you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looking at her watch.</i>] Past is past, Robert. And I think I ought
to go now. It is nine almost.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Impetuously.</i>] No, no. Not yet. There is one confession more and
we have the right to speak.</p>

<p>[<i>He crosses before the table rapidly and sits down beside
her.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Turning towards him, places her left hand on his shoulder.</i>] Yes,
Robert. I know that you like me. You need not tell me. [<i>Kindly.</i>]
You need not confess any more tonight.</p>

<p>[<i>A gust of wind enters through the porch, with a sound of moving
leaves. The lamp flickers quickly.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Pointing over his shoulder.</i>] Look! It is too high.</p>

<p>[<i>Without rising, he bends towards the table, and turns down the
wick more. The room is half dark. The light comes in more strongly
through the doorway of the bedroom.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
The wind is rising. I will close that door.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Listening.</i>] No, it is raining still. It was only a gust of
wind.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Touches her shoulder.</i>] Tell me if the air is too cold for you.
[<i>Half rising.</i>] I will close it.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Detaining him.</i>] No. I am not cold. Besides, I am going now,
Robert. I must.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Firmly.</i>] No, no. There is no <i>must</i> now. We were left here
for this. And you are wrong, Bertha. The past is not past. It is present
here now. My feeling for you is the same now as it was then, because
then&mdash;you slighted it.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No, Robert. I did not.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Continuing.</i>] You did. And I have felt it all these years without
knowing it&mdash;till now. Even while I lived&mdash;the kind of life you
know and dislike to think of&mdash;the kind of life to which you
condemned me.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes, when you slighted the common simple gift I had to offer
you&mdash;and took his gift instead.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looking at him.</i>] But you never...</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
No. Because you had chosen him. I saw that. I saw it on the first night
we met, we three together. Why did you choose him?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Bends her head.</i>] Is that not love?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Continuing.</i>] And every night when we two&mdash;he and
I&mdash;came to that corner to meet you I saw it and felt it. You
remember the corner, Bertha?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>As before.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
And when you and he went away for your walk and I went along the street
alone I felt it. And when he spoke to me about you and told me he was
going away&mdash;then most of all.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Why then most of all?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Because it was then that I was guilty of my first treason towards
him.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Robert, what are you saying? Your first treason against Dick?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Nods.</i>] And not my last. He spoke of you and himself. Of how your
life would be together&mdash;free and all that. Free, yes! He would not
even ask you to go with him. [<i>Bitterly.</i>] He did not. And you went
all the same.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I wanted to be with him. You know... [<i>Raising her head and looking at
him.</i>] You know how we were then&mdash;Dick and I.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Unheeding.</i>] I advised him to go alone&mdash;not to take you with
him&mdash;to live alone in order to see if what he felt for you was a
passing thing which might ruin your happiness and his career.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Well, Robert. It was unkind of you towards me. But I forgive you because
you were thinking of his happiness and mine.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Bending closer to her.</i>] No, Bertha. I was not. And that was my
treason. I was thinking of myself&mdash;that you might turn from him
when he had gone and he from you. Then I would have offered you my gift.
You know what it was now. The simple common gift that men offer to
women. Not the best perhaps. Best or worst&mdash;it would have been
yours.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Turning away from him.</i>] He did not take your advice.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>As before.</i>] No. And the night you ran away together&mdash;O, how
happy I was!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Pressing his hands.</i>] Keep calm, Robert. I know you liked me
always. Why did you not forget me?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Smiles bitterly.</i>] How happy I felt as I came back along the
quays and saw in the distance the boat lit up going down the black
river, taking you away from me! [<i>In a calmer tone.</i>] But why did
you choose him? Did you not like me at all?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes. I liked you because you were his friend. We often spoke about you.
Often and often. Every time you wrote or sent papers or books to Dick.
And I like you still, Robert. [<i>Looking into his eyes.</i>] I never
forgot you.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Nor I you. I knew I would see you again. I knew it the night you went
away&mdash;that you would come back. And that was why I wrote and worked
to see you again&mdash;here.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
And here I am. You were right.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Slowly.</i>] Nine years. Nine times more beautiful!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Smiling.</i>] But am I? What do you see in me?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Gazing at her.</i>] A strange and beautiful lady.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Almost disgusted.</i>] O, please don&rsquo;t call me such a
thing!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Earnestly.</i>] You are more. A young and beautiful queen.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>With a sudden laugh.</i>] O, Robert!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Lowering his voice and bending nearer to her.</i>] But do you not
know that you are a beautiful human being? Do you not know that you have
a beautiful body? Beautiful and young?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Gravely.</i>] Some day I will be old.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Shakes his head.</i>] I cannot imagine it. Tonight you are young and
beautiful. Tonight you have come back to me. [<i>With passion.</i>] Who
knows what will be tomorrow? I may never see you again or never see you
as I do now.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Would you suffer?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Looks round the room, without answering.</i>] This room and this
hour were made for your coming. When you have gone&mdash;all is
gone.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Anxiously.</i>] But you will see me again, Robert... as before.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Looks full at her.</i>] To make him&mdash;Richard&mdash;suffer.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He does not suffer.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Bowing his head.</i>] Yes, yes. He does.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He knows we like each other. Is there any harm, then?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Raising his head.</i>] No there is no harm. Why should we not? He
does not know yet what I feel. He has left us alone here at night, at
this hour, because he longs to know it&mdash;he longs to be
delivered.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
From what?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Moves closer to her and presses her arm as he speaks.</i>] From
every law, Bertha, from every bond. All his life he has sought to
deliver himself. Every chain but one he has broken and that one we are
to break. Bertha&mdash;you and I.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Almost inaudibly.</i>] Are you sure?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Still more warmly.</i>] I am sure that no law made by man is sacred
before the impulse of passion. [<i>Almost fiercely.</i>] Who made us for
one only? It is a crime against our own being if we are so. There is no
law before impulse. Laws are for slaves. Bertha, say my name! Let me
hear your voice say it. Softly!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Softly.</i>] Robert!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Puts his arm about her shoulder.</i>] Only the impulse towards youth
and beauty does not die. [<i>He points towards the porch.</i>]
Listen!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>In alarm.</i>] What?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
The rain falling. Summer rain on the earth. Night rain. The darkness and
warmth and flood of passion. Tonight the earth is loved&mdash;loved and
possessed. Her lover&rsquo;s arms around her; and she is silent. Speak,
dearest!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Suddenly leans forward and listens intently.</i>] Hush!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Listening, smiles.</i>] Nothing. Nobody. We are alone.</p>

<p>[<i>A gust of wind blows in through the porch, with a sound of shaken
leaves. The flame of the lamp leaps.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Pointing to the lamp.</i>] Look!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Only the wind. We have light enough from the other room.</p>

<p>[<i>He stretches his hand across the table and puts out the lamp. The
light from the doorway of the bedroom crosses the place where they sit.
The room is quite dark.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Are you happy? Tell me.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I am going now, Robert. It is very late. Be satisfied.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Caressing her hair.</i>] Not yet, not yet. Tell me, do you love me a
little?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I like you, Robert. I think you are good. [<i>Half rising.</i>] Are you
satisfied?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Detaining her, kisses her hair.</i>] Do not go, Bertha! There is
time still. Do you love me too? I have waited a long time. Do you love
us both&mdash;him and also me? Do you, Bertha? The truth! Tell me. Tell
me with your eyes. Or speak!</p>

<p>[<i>She does not answer. In the silence the rain is heard
falling.</i>]</p>

<h3><b>Third Act</b></h3>

<p><i>The drawingroom of Richard Rowan&rsquo;s house at Merrion. The
folding doors at the right are closed and also the double doors leading
to the garden. The green plush curtains are drawn across the window on
the left. The room is half dark. It is early in the morning of the next
day. Bertha sits beside the window looking out between the curtains. She
wears a loose saffron dressing gown. Her hair is combed loosely over the
ears and knotted at the neck. Her hands are folded in her lap. Her face
is pale and drawn.</i></p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Brigid</span> comes in through the folding
doors on the right with a featherbroom and duster. She is about to cross
but, seeing <span class="charname">Bertha</span>, she halts suddenly and
blesses herself instinctively.</i>]</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
Merciful hour, ma&rsquo;am. You put the heart across me. Why did you get
up so early?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
What time is it?</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
After seven, ma&rsquo;am. Are you long up?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Some time.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Approaching her.</i>] Had you a bad dream that woke you?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I didn&rsquo;t sleep all night. So I got up to see the sun rise.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Opens the double doors.</i>] It&rsquo;s a lovely morning now after
all the rain we had. [<i>Turns round.</i>] But you must be dead tired,
ma&rsquo;am. What will the master say at your doing a thing like that?
[<i>She goes to the door of the study and knocks.</i>] Master
Richard!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looks round.</i>] He is not there. He went out an hour ago.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
Out there, on the strand, is it?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Comes towards her and leans over the back of a chair.</i>] Are you
fretting yourself, ma&rsquo;am, about anything?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No, Brigid.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
Don&rsquo;t be. He was always like that, meandering off by himself
somewhere. He is a curious bird, Master Richard, and always was. Sure
there isn&rsquo;t a turn in him I don&rsquo;t know. Are you fretting now
maybe because he does be in there [<i>pointing to the study</i>] half
the night at his books? Leave him alone. He&rsquo;ll come back to you
again. Sure he thinks the sun shines out of your face, ma&rsquo;am.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Sadly.</i>] That time is gone.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Confidentially.</i>] And good cause I have to remember it&mdash;that
time
when he was paying his addresses to you. [<i>She sits down beside <span
class="charname">Bertha</span>. In a lower voice.</i>] Do you know that
he used to tell me all about you and nothing to his mother, God rest her
soul? Your letters and all.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
What? My letters to him?</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Delighted.</i>] Yes. I can see him sitting on the kitchen table,
swinging his legs and spinning out of him yards of talk about you and
him and Ireland and all kinds of devilment&mdash;to an ignorant old
woman like me. But that was always his way. But if he had to meet a
grand highup person he&rsquo;d be twice as grand himself. [<i>Suddenly
looks at <span class="charname">Bertha</span>.</i>] Is it crying you are
now? Ah, sure, don&rsquo;t cry. There&rsquo;s good times coming
still.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No, Brigid, that time comes only once in a lifetime. The rest of life is
good for nothing except to remember that time.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Is silent for a moment: then says kindly.</i>] Would you like a cup
of tea, ma&rsquo;am? That would make you all right.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes, I would. But the milkman has not come yet.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
No. Master Archie told me to wake him before he came. He&rsquo;s going
out for a jaunt in the car. But I&rsquo;ve a cup left overnight.
I&rsquo;ll have the kettle boiling in a jiffy. Would you like a nice egg
with it?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No, thanks.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
Or a nice bit of toast?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
No, Brigid, thanks. Just a cup of tea.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Crossing to the folding doors.</i>] I won&rsquo;t be a moment.
[<i>She stops, turns back and goes towards the door on the left.</i>]
But first I must waken Master Archie or there&rsquo;ll be ructions.</p>

<p>[<i>She goes out by the door on the left. After a few moments
<span class="charname">Bertha</span> rises and goes over to the study.
She opens the door wide and looks in. One can see a small untidy room
with many bookshelves and a large writingtable with papers and an
extinguished lamp and before it a padded chair. She remains standing for
some time in the doorway, then closes the door again without entering
the room. She returns to her chair by the window and sits down. <span
class="charname">Archie</span>, dressed as before, comes in by the door
on the right, followed by <span class="charname">Brigid</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Comes to her and, putting up his face to be kissed, says:</i>]
<i>Buon giorno</i>, mamma!</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Kissing him.</i>] <i>Buon giorno</i>, Archie! [<i>To
<span class="charname">Brigid</span>.</i>] Did you put another vest on
him under that one?</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
He wouldn&rsquo;t let me, ma&rsquo;am.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
I&rsquo;m not cold, mamma.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I said you were to put it on, didn&rsquo;t I?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
But where is the cold?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Takes a comb from her head and combs his hair back at both
sides.</i>] And the sleep is in your eyes still.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
He went to bed immediately after you went out last night,
ma&rsquo;am.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
You know he&rsquo;s going to let me drive, mamma.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Replacing the comb in her hair, embraces him suddenly.</i>] O, what
a big man to drive a horse!</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
Well, he&rsquo;s daft on horses, anyhow.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Releasing himself.</i>] I&rsquo;ll make him go quick. You will see
from the window, mamma. With the whip. [<i>He makes the gesture of
cracking a whip and shouts at the top of his voice.</i>]
<i>Avanti!</i></p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
Beat the poor horse, is it?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Come here till I clean your mouth. [<i>She takes her handkerchief from
the pocket of her gown, wets it with her tongue and cleans his
mouth.</i>] You&rsquo;re all smudges or something, dirty little creature
you are.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Repeats, laughing.</i>] Smudges! What is smudges?</p>

<p>[<i>The noise is heard of a milkcan rattled on the railings before
the window.</i>]</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Draws aside the curtains and looks out.</i>] Here he is!</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Rapidly.</i>] Wait. I&rsquo;m ready. Goodbye, mamma! [<i>He kisses
her hastily and turns to go.</i>] Is pappie up?</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Takes him by the arm.</i>] Come on with you now.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Mind yourself, Archie, and don&rsquo;t be long or I won&rsquo;t let you
go any more.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
All right. Look out of the window and you&rsquo;ll see me. Goodbye.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Brigid</span> and <span
class="charname">Archie</span> go out by the door on the left. <span
class="charname">Bertha</span> stands up and, drawing aside the curtains
still more, stands in the embrasure of the window looking out. The hall
door is heard opening: then a slight noise of voices and cans is heard.
The door is closed. After a moment or two <span
class="charname">Bertha</span> is seen waving her hand gaily in a
salute. <span class="charname">Brigid</span> enters and stands behind
her, looking over her shoulder.</i>]</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
Look at the sit of him! As serious as you like.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Suddenly withdrawing from her post.</i>] Stand out of the window. I
don&rsquo;t want to be seen.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
Why, ma&rsquo;am, what is it?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Crossing towards the folding doors.</i>] Say I&rsquo;m not up, that
I&rsquo;m not well. I can&rsquo;t see anyone.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Follows her.</i>] Who is it, ma&rsquo;am?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Halting.</i>] Wait a moment.</p>

<p>[<i>She listens. A knock is heard at the hall door.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Stands a moment in doubt, then.</i>] No, say I&rsquo;m in.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>In doubt.</i>] Here?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Hurriedly.</i>] Yes. Say I have just got up.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Brigid</span> goes out on the left.
<span class="charname">Bertha</span> goes towards the double doors and
fingers the curtains nervously, as if settling them. The hall door is
heard to open. Then <span class="charname">Beatrice Justice</span>
enters and, as <span class="charname">Bertha</span> does not turn at
once, stands in hesitation near the door on the left. She is dressed as
before and has a newspaper in her hand.</i>]</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Advances rapidly.</i>] Mrs Rowan, excuse me for coming at such an
hour.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Turns.</i>] Good morning, Miss Justice. [<i>She comes towards
her.</i>] Is anything the matter?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Nervously.</i>] I don&rsquo;t know. That is what I wanted to ask
you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looks curiously at her.</i>] You are out of breath. Won&rsquo;t you
sit down?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Sitting down.</i>] Thank you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Sits opposite her, pointing to her paper.</i>] Is there something in
the paper?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Laughs nervously: opens the paper.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
About Dick?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Yes. Here it is. A long article, a leading article, by my cousin. All
his life is here. Do you wish to see it?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Takes the paper, and opens it.</i>] Where is it?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
In the middle. It is headed: <i>A Distinguished Irishman.</i></p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Is it... for Dick or against him?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Warmly.</i>] O, for him! You can read what he says about Mr Rowan.
And I know that Robert stayed in town very late last night to write
it.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Nervously.</i>] Yes. Are you sure?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Yes. Very late. I heard him come home. It was long after two.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Watching her.</i>] It alarmed you? I mean to be awakened at that
hour of the morning.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I am a light sleeper. But I knew he had come from the office and then...
I suspected he had written an article about Mr Rowan and that was why he
came so late.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
How quick you were to think of that!</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Well, after what took place here yesterday afternoon&mdash;I mean what
Robert said, that Mr Rowan had accepted this position. It was only
natural I should think...</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Ah, yes. Naturally.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Hastily.</i>] But that is not what alarmed me. But immediately after
I heard a noise in my cousin&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Crumples together the paper in her hands, breathlessly.</i>] My God!
What is it? Tell me.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Observing her.</i>] Why does that upset you so much?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Sinking back, with a forced laugh.</i>] Yes, of course, it is very
foolish of me. My nerves are all upset. I slept very badly, too. That is
why I got up so early. But tell me what was it then?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Only the noise of his valise being pulled along the floor. Then I heard
him walking about his room, whistling softly. And then locking it and
strapping it.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He is going away!</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
That was what alarmed me. I feared he had had a quarrel with Mr Rowan
and that his article was an attack.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
But why should they quarrel? Have you noticed anything between them?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I thought I did. A coldness.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Lately?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
For some time past.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Smoothing the paper out.</i>] Do you know the reason?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Hesitatingly.</i>] No.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>After a pause.</i>] Well, but if this article is for him, as you
say, they have not quarrelled. [<i>She reflects a moment.</i>] And
written last night, too.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Yes. I bought the paper at once to see. But why, then, is he going away
so suddenly? I feel that there is something wrong. I feel that something
has happened between them.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Would you be sorry?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I would be very sorry. You see, Mrs Rowan, Robert is my first cousin and
it would grieve me very deeply if he were to treat Mr Rowan badly, now
that he has come back, or if they had a serious quarrel especially
because...</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Toying with the paper.</i>] Because?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Because it was my cousin who urged Mr Rowan always to come back. I have
that on my conscience.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
It should be on Mr Hand&rsquo;s conscience, should it not?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Uncertainly.</i>] On mine, too. Because&mdash;I spoke to my cousin
about Mr Rowan when he was away and, to a certain extent, it was
I...</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Nods slowly.</i>] I see. And that is on your conscience. Only
that?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I think so.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Almost cheerfully.</i>] It looks as if it was you, Miss Justice, who
brought my husband back to Ireland.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I, Mrs Rowan?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes, you. By your letters to him and then by speaking to your cousin as
you said just now. Do you not think that you are the person who brought
him back?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Blushing suddenly.</i>] No. I could not think that.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Watches her for a moment; then turning aside.</i>] You know that my
husband is writing very much since he came back.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Is he?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Did you not know? [<i>She points towards the study.</i>] He passes the
greater part of the night in there writing. Night after night.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
In his study?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Study or bedroom. You may call it what you please. He sleeps there, too,
on a sofa. He slept there last night. I can show you if you don&rsquo;t
believe me.</p>

<p>[<i>She rises to go towards the study. <span
class="charname">Beatrice</span>
half rises quickly and makes a gesture of refusal.</i>]</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I believe you, of course, Mrs Rowan, when you tell me.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Sitting down again.</i>] Yes. He is writing. And it must be about
something which has come into his life lately&mdash;since we came back
to Ireland. Some change. Do you know that any change has come into his
life? [<i>She looks searchingly at her.</i>] Do you know it or feel
it?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Answers her look steadily.</i>] Mrs Rowan, that is not a question to
ask me. If any change has come into his life since he came back you must
know and feel it.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
You could know it just as well. You are very intimate in this house.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I am not the only person who is intimate here.</p>

<p>[<i>They both look at each other coldly in silence for some moments.
<span class="charname">Bertha</span> lays aside the paper and sits down
on a chair nearer to <span class="charname">Beatrice</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Placing her hand on <span class="charname">Beatrice&rsquo;s</span>
knee.</i>] So you also hate me, Miss Justice?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>With an effort.</i>] Hate you? I?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Insistently but softly.</i>] Yes. You know what it means to hate a
person?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Why should I hate you? I have never hated anyone.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Have you ever loved anyone? [<i>She puts her hand on
<span class="charname">Beatrice&rsquo;s</span> wrist.</i>] Tell me. You
have?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Also softly.</i>] Yes. In the past.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Not now?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
No.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Can you say that to me&mdash;truly? Look at me.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Looks at her.</i>] Yes, I can.</p>

<p>[<i>A short pause. <span class="charname">Bertha</span> withdraws her
hand, and turns away her head in some embarrassment.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
You said just now that another person is intimate in this house. You
meant your cousin... Was it he?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Have you not forgotten him?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Quietly.</i>] I have tried to.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Clasping her hands.</i>] You hate me. You think I am happy. If you
only knew how wrong you are!</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Shakes her head.</i>] I do not.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Happy! When I do not understand anything that he writes, when I cannot
help him in any way, when I don&rsquo;t even understand half of what he
says to me sometimes! You could and you can. [<i>Excitedly.</i>] But I
am afraid for him, afraid for both of them. [<i>She stands up suddenly
and goes towards the davenport.</i>] He must not go away like that.
[<i>She takes a writing pad from the drawer and writes a few lines in
great haste.</i>] No, it is impossible! Is he mad to do such a thing?
[<i>Turning to <span class="charname">Beatrice</span>.</i>] Is he still
at home?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Watching her in wonder.</i>] Yes. Have you written to him to ask him
to come here?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Rises.</i>] I have. I will send Brigid across with it. Brigid!</p>

<p>[<i>She goes out by the door on the left rapidly.</i>]</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Gazing after her, instinctively:</i>] It is true, then!</p>

<p>[<i>She glances toward the door of <span
class="charname">Richard&rsquo;s</span> study and catches her head in
her hands. Then, recovering herself, she takes the paper from the little
table, opens it, takes a spectacle case from her handbag and, putting on
a pair of spectacles, bends down, reading it. <span
class="charname">Richard Rowan</span> enters from
the garden. He is dressed as before but wears a soft hat and carries a
thin cane.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Stands in the doorway, observing her for some moments.</i>] There
are demons [<i>he points out towards the strand</i>] out there. I heard
them jabbering since dawn.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Starts to her feet.</i>] Mr Rowan!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I assure you. The isle is full of voices. Yours also, <i>Otherwise I
could not see you,</i> it said. And her voice. But, I assure you, they
are all demons. I made the sign of the cross upside down and that
silenced them.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Stammering.</i>] I came here, Mr Rowan, so early because... to show
you this... Robert wrote it... about you... last night.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Takes off his hat.</i>] My dear Miss Justice, you told me yesterday,
I think, why you came here and I never forget anything. [<i>Advancing
towards her, holding out his hand.</i>] Good morning.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Suddenly takes off her spectacles and places the paper in his
hands.</i>] I came for this. It is an article about you. Robert wrote it
last night. Will you read it?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Bows.</i>] Read it now? Certainly.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Looks at him in despair.</i>] O, Mr Rowan, it makes me suffer to
look at you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Opens and reads the paper.</i>] <i>Death of the Very Reverend Canon
Mulhall</i>. Is that it?</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Bertha</span> appears at the door on the
left and stands to listen.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Turns over a page.</i>] Yes, here we are! <i>A Distinguished
Irishman.</i> [<i>He begins to read in a rather loud hard voice.</i>]
Not the least vital of the problems which confront our country is the
problem of her attitude towards those of her children who, having left
her in her hour of need, have been called back to her now on the eve of
her longawaited victory, to her whom in loneliness and exile they have
at last learned to love. In exile, we have said, but here we must
distinguish. There is an economic and there is a spiritual exile.
There are those who left her to seek the bread by which men live and
there are others, nay, her most favoured children, who left her to seek
in other lands that food of the spirit by which a nation of human beings
is sustained in life. Those who recall the intellectual life of Dublin
of a decade since will have many memories of Mr Rowan. Something of that
fierce indignation which lacerated the heart...</p>

<p>[<i>He raises his eyes from the paper and sees <span
class="charname">Bertha</span> standing in the doorway. Then he lays
aside the paper and looks at her. A long silence.</i>]</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>With an effort.</i>] You see, Mr Rowan, your day has dawned at last.
Even here. And you see that you have a warm friend in Robert, a friend
who understands you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Did you notice the little phrase at the beginning: <i>those who left her
in her hour of need?</i></p>

<p>[<i>He looks searchingly at <span class="charname">Bertha</span>,
turns and walks into his study, closing the door behind him.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Speaking half to herself.</i>] I gave up everything for him,
religion, family, my own peace.</p>

<p>[<i>She sits down heavily in an armchair. <span
class="charname">Beatrice</span> comes towards her.</i>]</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Weakly.</i>] But do you not feel also that Mr Rowan&rsquo;s
ideas...</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Bitterly.</i>] Ideas and ideas! But the people in this world have
other ideas or pretend to. They have to put up with him in spite of his
ideas because he is able to do something. Me, no. I am nothing.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
You stand by his side.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>With increasing bitterness.</i>] Ah, nonsense, Miss Justice! I am
only a thing he got entangled with and my son is&mdash;the nice name
they give those children. Do you think I am a stone? Do you think I
don&rsquo;t see it in their eyes and in their manner when they have to
meet me?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Do not let them humble you, Mrs Rowan.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Haughtily.</i>] Humble me! I am very proud of myself, if you want to
know. What have they ever done for him? I made him a man. What are they
all in his life? No more than the dirt under his boots! [<i>She stands
up and walks excitedly to and fro.</i>] He can despise me, too, like the
rest of them&mdash;now. And you can despise me. But you will never
humble me, any of you.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
Why do you accuse me?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Going to her impulsively.</i>] I am in such suffering. Excuse me if
I was rude. I want us to be friends. [<i>She holds out her hands.</i>]
Will you?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Taking her hands.</i>] Gladly.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Looking at her.</i>] What lovely long eyelashes you have! And your
eyes have such a sad expression!</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Smiling.</i>] I see very little with them. They are very weak.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Warmly.</i>] But beautiful.</p>

<p>[<i>She embraces her quietly and kisses her. Then withdraws from her
a little shyly. <span class="charname">Brigid</span> comes in from the
left.</i>]</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
I gave it to himself, ma&rsquo;am.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Did he send a message?</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
He was just going out, ma&rsquo;am. He told me to say he&rsquo;d be here
after me.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Thanks.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
[<i>Going.</i>] Would you like the tea and the toast now,
ma&rsquo;am?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Not now, Brigid. After perhaps. When Mr Hand comes show him in at
once.</p>

<p>BRIGID.<br/>
Yes, ma&rsquo;am.</p>

<p>[<i>She goes out on the left.</i>]</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I will go now, Mrs Rowan, before he comes.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Somewhat timidly.</i>] Then we are friends?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>In the same tone.</i>] We will try to be. [<i>Turning.</i>] Do you
allow me to go out through the garden? I don&rsquo;t want to meet my
cousin now.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Of course. [<i>She takes her hand.</i>] It is so strange that we spoke
like this now. But I always wanted to. Did you?</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
I think I did, too.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Smiling.</i>] Even in Rome. When I went out for a walk with Archie I
used to think about you, what you were like, because I knew about you
from Dick. I used to look at different persons, coming out of churches
or going by in carriages, and think that perhaps they were like you.
Because Dick told me you were dark.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Again nervously.</i>] Really?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Pressing her hand.</i>] Goodbye then&mdash;for the present.</p>

<p>BEATRICE.<br/>
[<i>Disengaging her hand.</i>] Good morning.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I will see you to the gate.</p>

<p>[<i>She accompanies her out through the double doors. They go down
through the garden. <span class="charname">Richard Rowan</span> comes in

he turns away, comes to the little table, takes up the paper and reads.

doorway and stands watching him till he has finished. He lays down the
paper again and turns to go back to his study.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Dick!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Stopping.</i>] Well?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
You have not spoken to me.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I have nothing to say. Have you?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Do you not wish to know&mdash;about what happened last night?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
That I will never know.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I will tell you if you ask me.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
You will tell me. But I will never know. Never in this world.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Moving towards him.</i>] I will tell you the truth, Dick, as I
always told you. I never lied to you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Clenching his hands in the air, passionately.</i>] Yes, yes. The
truth! But I will never know, I tell you.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Why, then, did you leave me last night?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Bitterly.</i>] In your hour of need.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Threateningly.</i>] You urged me to it. Not because you love me. If
you loved me or if you knew what love was you would not have left me.
For your own sake you urged me to it.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I did not make myself. I am what I am.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
To have it always to throw against me. To make me humble before you, as
you always did. To be free yourself. [<i>Pointing towards the
garden.</i>] With her! And that is your love! Every word you say is
false.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Controlling himself.</i>] It is useless to ask you to listen to
me.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Listen to you! She is the person for listening. Why would you waste your
time with me? Talk to her.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Nods his head.</i>] I see. You have driven her away from me now, as
you drove everyone else from my side&mdash;every friend I ever had,
every human being that ever tried to approach me. You hate her.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Warmly.</i>] No such thing! I think you have made her unhappy as you
have made me and as you made your dead mother unhappy and killed her.
Womankiller! That is your name.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Turns to go.</i>] <i>Arrivederci!</i></p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Excitedly.</i>] She is a fine and high character. I like her. She is
everything that I am not&mdash;in birth and education. You tried to ruin
her but you could not. Because she is well able for you&mdash;what I am
not. And you know it.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Almost shouting.</i>] What the devil are you talking about her
for?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Clasping her hands.</i>] O, how I wish I had never met you! How I
curse that day!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Bitterly.</i>] I am in the way, is it? You would like to be free
now. You have only to say the word.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Proudly.</i>] Whenever you like I am ready.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
So that you could meet your lover&mdash;freely?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Night after night?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Gazing before her and speaking with intense passion.</i>] To meet my
lover! [<i>Holding out her arms before her.</i>] My lover! Yes! My
lover!</p>

<p>[<i>She bursts suddenly into tears and sinks down on a chair,
covering her face with her hands. <span class="charname">Richard</span>
approaches her slowly and touches her on the shoulder.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Bertha! [<i>She does not answer.</i>] Bertha, you are free.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Pushes his hand aside and starts to her feet.</i>] Don&rsquo;t touch
me! You are a stranger to me. You do not understand anything in
me&mdash;not one thing in my heart or soul. A stranger! I am living with
a stranger!</p>

<p>[<i>A knock is heard at the hall door. <span
class="charname">Bertha</span> dries her eyes quickly with her
handkerchief and settles the front of her gown. <span

keenly and, turning away, walks into his study. <span
class="charname">Robert Hand</span> enters from the left. He is dressed
in dark brown and carries in his hand a brown Alpine hat.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Closing the door quietly behind him.</i>] You sent for me.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Rises.</i>] Yes. Are you mad to think of going away like
that&mdash;without even coming here&mdash;without saying anything?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Advancing towards the table on which the paper lies, glances at
it.</i>] What I have to say I said here.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
When did you write it? Last night&mdash;after I went away?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Gracefully.</i>] To be quite accurate, I wrote part of it&mdash;in
my mind&mdash;before you went away. The rest&mdash;the worst
part&mdash;I wrote after. Much later.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
And you could write last night!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Shrugs his shoulders.</i>] I am a welltrained animal. [<i>He comes
closer to her.</i>] I passed a long wandering night after... in my
office, at the vicechancellor&rsquo;s house, in a nightclub, in the
streets, in my room. Your image was always before my eyes, your hand in
my hand. Bertha, I will never forget last night. [<i>He lays his hat on
the table and takes her hand.</i>] Why do you not look at me? May I not
touch you?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Points to the study.</i>] Dick is in there.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Drops her hand.</i>] In that case children be good.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Where are you going?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
To foreign parts. That is, to my cousin Jack Justice, <i>alias</i> Doggy
Justice, in Surrey. He has a nice country place there and the air is
mild.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Why are you going?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Looks at her in silence.</i>] Can you not guess one reason?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
On account of me?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes. It is not pleasant for me to remain here just now.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Sits down helplessly.</i>] But this is cruel of you, Robert. Cruel
to me and to him also.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Has he asked... what happened?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Joining her hands in despair.</i>] No. He refuses to ask me
anything. He says he will never know.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Nods gravely.</i>] Richard is right there. He is always right.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
But, Robert, you must speak to him.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
What am I to say to him?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
The truth! Everything!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Reflects.</i>] No, Bertha. I am a man speaking to a man. I cannot
tell him everything.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
He will believe that you are going away because you are afraid to face
him after last night.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>After a pause.</i>] Well, I am not a coward any more than he. I will
see him.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Rises.</i>] I will call him.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Catching her hands.</i>] Bertha! What happened last night? What is
the truth that I am to tell? [<i>He gazes earnestly into her eyes.</i>]
Were you mine in that sacred night of love? Or have I dreamed it?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Smiles faintly.</i>] Remember your dream of me. You dreamed that I
was yours last night.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
And that is the truth&mdash;a dream? That is what I am to tell?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Kisses both her hands.</i>] Bertha! [<i>In a softer voice.</i>] In
all my life only that dream is real. I forget the rest. [<i>He kisses
her hands again.</i>] And now I can tell him the truth. Call him.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Bertha</span> goes to the door of
<span class="charname">Richard&rsquo;s</span> study and knocks. There is
no answer. She knocks again.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Dick! [<i>There is no answer.</i>] Mr Hand is here. He wants to speak to
you, to say goodbye. He is going away. [<i>There is no answer. She beats
her hand loudly on the panel of the door and calls in an alarmed
voice.</i>] Dick! Answer me!</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Richard Rowan</span> comes in from the
study. He comes at once to <span class="charname">Robert</span> but does
not hold out his hand.</i>]</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Calmly.</i>] I thank you for your kind article about me. Is it true
that you have come to say goodbye?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
There is nothing to thank me for, Richard. Now and always I am your
friend. Now more than ever before. Do you believe me, Richard?</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Richard</span> sits down on a chair and
buries his face in his hands. <span class="charname">Bertha</span> and

she turns away and goes out quietly on the right. <span
class="charname">Robert</span> goes towards <span
class="charname">Richard</span> and stands near him, resting his hands
on the back of a chair, looking down at him. There is a long silence. A

passes along the road outside.</i>]</p>

<p>THE FISHWOMAN.<br/>
Fresh Dublin bay herrings! Fresh Dublin bay herrings! Dublin bay
herrings!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Quietly.</i>] I will tell you the truth, Richard. Are you
listening?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Raises his face and leans back to listen.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Robert</span> sits on the chair beside
him. The <span class="charname">Fishwoman</span> is heard calling out
farther away.</i>]</p>

<p>THE FISHWOMAN.<br/>
Fresh herrings! Dublin bay herrings!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I failed, Richard. That is the truth. Do you believe me?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I am listening.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I failed. She is yours, as she was nine years ago, when you met her
first.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
When we met her first, you mean.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes. [<i>He looks down for some moments.</i>] Shall I go on?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
She went away. I was left alone&mdash;for the second time. I went to the
vicechancellor&rsquo;s house and dined. I said you were ill and would
come another night. I made epigrams new and old&mdash;that one about the
statues also. I drank claret cup. I went to my office and wrote my
article. Then...</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Then?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Then I went to a certain nightclub. There were men there&mdash;and also
women. At least, they looked like women. I danced with one of them. She
asked me to see her home. Shall I go on?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I saw her home in a cab. She lives near Donnybrook. In the cab took
place what the subtle Duns Scotus calls a death of the spirit. Shall I
go on?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
She wept. She told me she was the divorced wife of a barrister. I
offered her a sovereign as she told me she was short of money. She would
not take it and wept very much. Then she drank some melissa water from a
little bottle which she had
in her satchel. I saw her enter her house. Then I walked home. In my
room I found that my coat was all stained with the melissa water. I had
no luck even with my coats yesterday: that was the second one. The idea
came to me then to change my suit and go away by the morning boat. I
packed my valise and went to bed. I am going away by the next train to
my cousin, Jack Justice, in Surrey. Perhaps for a fortnight. Perhaps
longer. Are you disgusted?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Why did you not go by the boat?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I slept it out.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
You intended to go without saying goodbye&mdash;without coming here?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Why?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
My story is not very nice, is it?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
But you have come.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Bertha sent me a message to come.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
But for that...?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
But for that I should not have come.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Did it strike you that if you had gone without coming here I should have
understood it&mdash;in my own way?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Yes, it did.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
What, then, do you wish me to believe?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I wish you to believe that I failed. That Bertha is yours now as she was
nine years ago, when you&mdash;when we&mdash;met her first.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Do you want to know what I did?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
No.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I came home at once.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Did you hear Bertha return?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
No. I wrote all the night. And thought. [<i>Pointing to the study.</i>]
In there. Before dawn I went out and walked the strand from end to
end.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Shaking his head.</i>] Suffering. Torturing yourself.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Hearing voices about me. The voices of those who say they love me.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Points to the door on the right.</i>] One. And mine?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Another still.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Smiles and touches his forehead with his right forefinger.</i>]
True. My interesting but somewhat melancholy cousin. And what did they
tell you?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
They told me to despair.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
A queer way of showing their love, I must say! And will you despair?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Rising.</i>] No.</p>

<p>[<i>A noise is heard at the window. <span
class="charname">Archie&rsquo;s</span> face is seen flattened against
one of the panes. He is heard calling.</i>]</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Open the window! Open the window!</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Looks at <span class="charname">Richard</span>.</i>] Did you hear
his voice, too, Richard, with the others&mdash;out there on the strand?
Your son&rsquo;s voice. [<i>Smiling.</i>] Listen! How full it is of
despair!</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Open the window, please, will you?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Perhaps, there, Richard, is the freedom we seek&mdash;you in one way, I
in another. In him and not in us. Perhaps...</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Perhaps...?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
I said <i>perhaps</i>. I would say almost surely if...</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
If what?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>With a faint smile.</i>] If he were mine.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes to the window and opens it. <span
class="charname">Archie</span> scrambles in.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
Like yesterday&mdash;eh?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Good morning, Mr Hand. [<i>He runs to <span
class="charname">Richard</span> and kisses him:</i>] <i>Buon giorno,
babbo</i>.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
<i>Buon giorno</i>, Archie.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
And where were you, my young gentleman?</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Out with the milkman. I drove the horse. We went to Booterstown. [<i>He
takes off his cap and throws it on a chair.</i>] I am very hungry.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Takes his hat from the table.</i>] Richard, goodbye. [<i>Offering
his hand.</i>] To our next meeting!</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Rises, touches his hand.</i>] Goodbye.</p>

<p>[<i><span class="charname">Bertha</span> appears at the door on the
right.</i>]</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>Catches sight of her: to <span class="charname">Archie</span>.</i>]
Get your cap. Come on with me. I&rsquo;ll buy you a cake and I&rsquo;ll
tell you a story.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>To <span class="charname">Bertha</span>.</i>] May I, mamma?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
[<i>Takes his cap.</i>] I am ready.</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
[<i>To <span class="charname">Richard</span> and <span
class="charname">Bertha</span>.</i>] Goodbye to pappa and mamma. But not
a big goodbye.</p>

<p>ARCHIE.<br/>
Will you tell me a fairy story, Mr Hand?</p>

<p>ROBERT.<br/>
A fairy story? Why not? I am your fairy godfather.</p>

Dick, dear, do you believe now that I have been true to you? Last night
and always?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Sadly.</i>] Do not ask me, Bertha.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Pressing him more closely.</i>] I have been, dear. Surely you
believe me. I gave you myself&mdash;all. I gave up all for you. You took
me&mdash;and you left me.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
When did I leave you?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
You left me: and I waited for you to come back to me. Dick, dear, come
here to me. Sit down. How tired you must be!</p>

<p>[<i>She draws him towards the lounge. He sits down, almost reclining,
resting on his arm. She sits on the mat before the lounge, holding his
hand.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes, dear. I waited for you. Heavens, what I suffered then&mdash;when we
lived in Rome! Do you remember the terrace of our house?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I used to sit there, waiting, with the poor child with his toys, waiting
till he got sleepy. I could see all the roofs of the city and the river,
the <i>Tevere</i>. What is its name?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
The Tiber.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Caressing her cheek with his hand.</i>] It was lovely, Dick, only I
was so sad. I was alone, Dick, forgotten by you and by all. I felt my
life was ended.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
It had not begun.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
And I used to look at the sky, so beautiful, without a cloud and the
city you said was so old: and then I used to think of Ireland and about
ourselves.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Ourselves?</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Yes. Ourselves. Not a day passes that I do not see ourselves, you and
me, as we were when we met first. Every day of my life I see that. Was I
not true to you all that time?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Sighs deeply.</i>] Yes, Bertha. You were my bride in exile.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Wherever you go, I will follow you. If you wish to go away now I will go
with you.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I will remain. It is too soon yet to despair.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Again caressing his hand.</i>] It is not true that I want to drive
everyone from you. I wanted to bring you close together&mdash;you and
him. Speak to me. Speak out all your heart to me. What you feel and what
you suffer.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
I am wounded, Bertha.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
How wounded, dear? Explain to me what you mean. I will try to understand
everything you say. In what way are you wounded?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Releases his hand and, taking her head between his hands, bends it
back and gazes long into her eyes.</i>] I have a deep, deep wound of
doubt in my soul.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
[<i>Motionless.</i>] Doubt of me?</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
Yes.</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
I am yours. [<i>In a whisper.</i>] If I died this moment, I am
yours.</p>

<p>RICHARD.<br/>
[<i>Still gazing at her and speaking as if to an absent person.</i>] I
have wounded my soul for you&mdash;a deep wound of doubt which can never
be healed. I can never know, never in this world. I do not wish to know
or to believe. I do not care. It is not in the darkness of belief that I
desire you. But in restless living wounding doubt. To hold you by no
bonds, even of love, to be united with you in body and soul in utter
nakedness&mdash;for this I longed. And now I am tired for a while,
Bertha. My wound tires me.</p>

<p>[<i>He stretches himself out wearily along the lounge.
<span class="charname">Bertha</span> holds his hand still, speaking very
softly.</i>]</p>

<p>BERTHA.<br/>
Forget me, Dick. Forget me and love me again as you did the first time.
I want my lover. To meet him, to go to him, to give myself to him. You,
Dick. O, my strange wild lover, come back to me again!</p>

<p>[<i>She closes her eyes.</i>]</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
